VAE-Text-Generation
Implementation of "Generating Sentences from a Continuous Space" paper using pytorch and torchtext. Generate sentences based on imdb review dataset
Prerequisites

Python 2.7
Pytorch 0.4.0
Torchtext 0.2.0

Data
Data can be found at data/imdb where I have splitted imdb review paras into sentences, picked those with word count more than 5 and less than 20, splitted them into train set and test set based on 7:3 ratio. In total, there are around 5.5 lakh training sentences and 2.4 lakh testing sentences
Training
To train the model from the beginning, run:
python main.py

To resume training from a saved model, run:
python main.py --resume_training=True

Testing
To generate samples from a saved model, run:
python main.py --to_train=False

Notice that if you try to generate a sample from model which is not trained enough, it might generate sentences with words greater than 20.
Samples with default configuration and after 120 epochs:
