Objective:

To analyze and find out the safest road which are less likely to cause accident with the given large dataset.
To find out the common reason that may lead to the accident by measuring accuracy of dataset with different machine learning
model.
To remove cluster and unnecessary information by extracting useful and accident-related information.
