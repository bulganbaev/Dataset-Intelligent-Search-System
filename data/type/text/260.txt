Speech Play
In this repo I play around with wav-textword pairs. I intend to use soft attention over
the image from Show, Attend and tell in order to correctly classify wich class of
words a spectrogram represents.
Data:

58252 training pairs
The spectrograms are (99, 161) by default.
30 different classes

So Far

Dataset and Dataloaders loads wav from file and calculates spectrogram
A Simple Spectrograms -> CNN -> classes model
Simple training on cuda with tensorboard plotting loss

Dataset
A nice dataset from kaggle with (text, wav) pairs.
Everything in dataset.py is based on
DadidS Kaggle Kernel
