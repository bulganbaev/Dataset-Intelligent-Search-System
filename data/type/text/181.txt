ML310 FINAL PROJECT
Using the politwoops dataset, we use machine learning to analyze the tweets, breaking the project up into the following 4 categories:

exploratory analysis and text-mining (notebook)
deletion times (how long tweets were live) (notebook)
sentiment analysis (notebook)
hashtag recommendation system (notebook)
