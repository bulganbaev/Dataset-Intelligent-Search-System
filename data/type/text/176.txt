Text-Classification
In this project i have implemented text classification Naïve Bayes algorithm for 20-NewsGroups dataset.
Overall accuracy, F1 score and Vocalbulary size is displayed when the code is executed.
The following categories are used from 20news­bydate dataset : comp.graphics,
rec.autos, and talk.politics.guns has been used
he following preprocessing steps have been done :

Special characters and numeric characters have been removed from text document using regular expression
Word lowercasing is done
Words with string length less than three is removed
Stopwords are removed from the text document using NLTK library
Multinomial Naive bayes algorithm is used for text document classification
