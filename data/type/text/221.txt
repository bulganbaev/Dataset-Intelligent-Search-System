Seq2Seq models for text normalization
This repository contains the models I've been using for my MsC thesis on designing and comparing seq2seq models for the text-normalization problem. Along with the source code I have also released the preprocessing files I used to get a dataset from the Google's Text Normalization challenge on Kaggle.
The code uses Python 3.6 along wiht Pytorch 4.0. A requirements.txt file is located at the root of this repository describing all the libraries I had on my conda environment.
