text_classification
Exploration of text classification from public datasets, especially emotion labels. See PDF
Code
Load and save data: load the datasets in use, preprocess them and save split/tokenized versions as .pkl files. Edit main() function to change output
Train model: train several models, need to edit the script to change parameter space and select model

Types of text classification

types

regression onto numeric data
topic modeling (unsupervised)


But there are all these other NLP use-cases that we miss!

Text-generation | Question-answering
Syntax identification | POS tagging
EDA

and other libraries for data-viz of text/corpus






Challenges

How to remove bias from the dataset?

Embedding models contain bias. To overcome this we have to document exactly which terms to target and either:

identify the sources of bias in the data and leave them out (this would be apply to the case where we use TF-IDF)
reduce bias by projecting the embeddings to neturalize it




Challenges with NLP on non-English data? How to mitigate?

Locate a giant corpus of non-English text and train new word-embeddings
Use open-sourced pre-trained embeddings




Emotion classification

Datasets on emotion classification

State-of-the-art
Limitations of text-classification

human benchmark
multi-annotator accuracy


Possible use-cases

validated in academia
deployed in industry
What is the scope of a hyper-personalized emotion-classification model? What kind of data do we need to train this?
