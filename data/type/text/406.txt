Welcome to american-football.db
A free open public domain National Football League (NFL) database 'n' schema
for use in any (programming) language
(e.g. uses plain text fixtures/data sets).
Usage
Use the sportdb command line tool to build your own football.db copy
from the plain text fixtures.  Example:
Step 1:  Get a copy of the world.db fixtures
$ git clone git://github.com/openmundi/world.db.git

Step 2:  Get a copy of the american-football.db fixtures
$ git clone git://github.com/opensport/american-football.db.git

Step 3:  Let's build the football.db
$ sportdb setup --include ./american-football.db --worldinclude ./world.db

That's it.
See the sportdb command line tool project for more.
