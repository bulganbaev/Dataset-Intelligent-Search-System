text2sql-data
This repository contains data and code for building and evaluating systems that map sentences to SQL, developed as part of:

Improving Text-to-SQL Evaluation Methodology,
Catherine Finegan-Dollak, Jonathan K. Kummerfeld, Li Zhang, Karthik Ramanathan, Sesh Sadasivam, Rui Zhang, and Dragomir Radev,
ACL 2018

For a range of domains, we provide:

Sentences with annotated variables
SQL queries
A database schema
A database

These are improved forms of prior datasets and a new dataset we developed.
We have separate files describing the datasets, systems, and tools.

Contributions
We put substantial effort into fixing bugs in the datasets, but none of them are perfect.
If you find a bug, please submit a pull request with a fix.
We will be merging fixes into a development branch and only infrequently merging all of those changes into the master branch (at which point this page will be adjusted to note that it is a new release).
This approach is intended to balance the need for clear comparisons between systems, while also improving the data.
For some ideas of issues to address, see our list of known issues.
