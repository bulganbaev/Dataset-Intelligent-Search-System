Deception-Detection-on-Amazon-reviews-dataset
A SVM model that classifies the reviews as real or fake. Used both the review text and the additional features contained in the data set to build a model that predicted with over 90% accuracy without using any deep learning techniques.
NLTK and Sklearn python libraries used to pre-process the data and implement cross-validation.
Worked with a recently released corpus of Amazon reviews
Finally, did an exploratory analysis on the dataset using seaborn and Matplotlib to explore some of the linguistic and stylistic traits of the reviews and compared the two classes.
