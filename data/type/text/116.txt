SCENE TEXT REMOVAL
A synthetic benchmark database for scene text removal is now released by Deep Learning and Vision Computing Lab of South China University of Technology. The database can be downloaded through the following links:


Yunpan : (link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1wwBwgm-n2A7iykoD0i37iQ PASSWORD: vk8f) (Size = 6.3G).


Google Driver: (link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1l_yJm1vWV7TF7vDcaVa7FqZLfW7ASYeo) (Size = 6.3G).
On the other hand, we collected 1000 images from the ICDAR 2017 MLT subdataset which only contains English text to enlarge real data, and the background image(label) is generated by manually erasing the text. The database can be downloaded through the following links:

Description
The training set of synthetic database consists of a total of 8000 images and the test set contains 800 images; all the training and test samples are resized to 512 × 512. The code for generating synthetic dataset and more synthetic text images as described in “Ankush Gupta, Andrea Vedaldi, Andrew Zisserman, Synthetic Data for Text localisation in Natural Images, CVPR 2016", and can be found in (https://github.com/ankush-me/SynthText).
Besides, all the real scene text images are also resized to 512 × 512.
For more details, please refer to our arxiv paper.
