sci-paper-miner
Generate datasets of academic research papers (including full-text) based on Core[1] research paper text mines.
Setup

Run pip install -r requirements.txt
Obtain an api key here for Core.

Usage

Set the target query in crawl_core.py. This currently can include the repository number (set to arXiv by default), range of years and topics (arXiv specific).
Default is set for all CS papers from arXiv between 2006-2018
Run python crawl_core.py <your-api-key>

Future

 Extract citation information (currently not extracted for arXiv, contacted CORE and apparently citation extraction is limited today due to computational constraints but will be completed over the next few months)
