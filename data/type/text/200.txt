Spark ML Decision Tree Example
Extending the Spark ML examples to a real world text dataset. You never see these and this is a exercise to share the concept on real text data.
Instructions:
Clone the repo to your IDE. 
Create your Google Cloud Dataproc cluster 
Create a storage bucket. 
Grab the datafile from UCI ML repo 
Upload datfile to storage bucket 
Edit the scala file on line 42 with the location of the datafile 
From the base directory run: 
sbt clean assembly
Upload the jar to the Storage Bucket 
Launch the job pointing the the uploaded jar.
This example runs on the UCI Machine Learning repo dataset found here:
