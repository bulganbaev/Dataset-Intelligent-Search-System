Retrained the model using  Flickr 30k image dataset which contains 158873 image caption.
Edited the generate function  to redirect the output to a file (optional). Pass return_as_list=True to the generate function to get the output as list (preferred).
Requirements: textgenrnn that uses Python3 and run on top on Tensorflow
