This dataset has been used in this paper:
Visual Re-ranking with Natural Language Understanding for Text Spotting https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.12738.pdf
This dataset is based on COCO-text, Please visit https://github.com/andreasveit/coco-text. COCO-text is based on Microsoft COCO Please visit http://mscoco.org/ for more information on COCO-dataset, including the image data, object annotatins and caption annotations.
1 - Extracting  full images with bounding box (gt) from COCO-text

COCO-text offical API python 2,7
Run coco_api_modified.py Extract full image with its gt (json files)

2) Extracting  the Bounding box and top-k objects (from object classifer)

Matlab 2018 - Free 30 days trial you only need to run it once
MatConvNet open source deep learning freamework
Run Extract_BBox.m file 1 bounding box file 2 full image



After installing MatConvNet you need to install pre-trained weight Resent152
Visual contexts (object, places*)

Image_id, spotted word(gt), objects, places
Example: COCO_train2014_000000000081.jpg,airfracne, airliner, airfield

*You can find the model Places365-CNNs
For testing (object1, object2, places)
This dataset from ICDAR2017 Robust Reading Challenge on COCO-Text, Task 3 End-to-End Recognition
