Description
An atomic edit is defined as an edit e applied to a natural language expression S as the insertion, deletion, or substitution of a sub-expression P such that both the original expression S and the resulting expression e(S) are well-formed semantic constituents (MacCartney, 2009). In this corpus, we release such atomic insertions and deletions made to sentences in wikipedia. Please click on the numbers below to download the data.

Example of an insertion:
"She died there after a long illness." + "in 1949" = "She died there in 1949 after a long illness."
Example of a deletion:
"She dreams about entering the Black Lodge and about a ring." - "and about a ring." = "She dreams about entering the Black Lodge."
For each language we provide two files, one each for insertions and deletions. The files contains the following tab-separated columns:
