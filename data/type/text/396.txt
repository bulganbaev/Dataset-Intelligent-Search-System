 COCO-Text-Patch
COCO-Text-Patch is the first text verification data set created to encourage researchers to use machine learning techniques for text verification which will in turn enhance the whole end-to-end text detection and recognition process. 

The data set is derived from COCO-Text and contains approximately 354 thousands images labeled as text and non-text.

  Creating the data set 
to create the data set you have to:-
-In the COCOAPI folder, unzip the COCO_Text.json.gz file
-Download the COCO 2014 training data set from http://msvocds.blob.core.windows.net/coco2014/train2014.zip
-Make sure you have Python 2.7 installed with numpy, skimage, math, Image, HD5 packages
-Clone the Git repository  
-From Python shell run createdataset.py

  supplied models 
 the folder "models" contains model description files ready to be used in caffe to train the models descibed in our paper "Text Patches Data Set for Text verification"
 the folder contains model desciptions as well as suggested solver files.
 you need to have Caffe installed from http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/
