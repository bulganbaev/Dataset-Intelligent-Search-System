Naive-Bayes-classifier-for-text-file-classification
Naive Bayesian classifier is implemented using Python 3.
Classified a massive collection of 20,000 documents (news groups dataset) into 20 labels.
Project involved 3 stages:

Pre-processing
Removal of stop words using NTLK
Implementation of Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm to perform text classification

Requirements:

Python version 3 or higher (Anaconda distribution recommended)
Training and Test dataset must be in same folder as that of Python script.
Ensure 'nltk' library has been downloaded.
import nltk
nltk.download()
