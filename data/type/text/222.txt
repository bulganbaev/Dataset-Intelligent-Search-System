text_search_api_enron_scandal
Description
In this project I have built a text search api from scratch using python, REST, and natural language processing tools on the publicly available enron dataset. I have used nltk (natural language toolkit) library to clean, tokenize, and lemmatize the email text of enron dataset.
Getting Started
This project was built on python 3.6 version. Ensure you have python 3.6 version installed and running on your machine and then follow the below instructions:

Clone the project from the repository
Run api.py file at ../src/api.py
Reference CURL request to hit the API: curl -X GET 'http://localhost:5000/search?key=wheat'
