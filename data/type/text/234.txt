wiki-corpora-generator
A script that generates corpora (preferably for further exploration/exploiation
in context of Natural Language Processing) by dumping text from rendered
Wikipedia pages and traversing pages they point to using Breath First Search.
The process of dumping goes as follows:


The article/page specified in --title added to a Queue.


The first article/page title from Queue is taken. It is then dumped and if
it contains links to other pages (that is those that were not visited yet)
these are added to a Queue.


Part 2. is repeated until the Queue is not empty or the --limit of
articles/pages has not been reached.


Note that this script does not only work on en.wikipedia.org but also on any
other Wikipedia locale. The language can be specified with the --lang
parameter.
This can be useful when generating a corpora on a given topic (and possibly in
different languages).
Example
    $ python wikicg.py --title 'Artificial intelligence' --count 10
    Dumped (10) <WikipediaPage 'Artificial intelligence'>
    Dumped (9) <WikipediaPage '2001: A Space Odyssey'>
