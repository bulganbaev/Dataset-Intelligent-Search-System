Boston Traffic Condition Complaints
Problem: The task is to do text classification on a dataset of complaints about traffic conditions to the city of Boston. There are two goals:

First, try to predict the type of complaint (“REQUESTTYPE”) from the complaint text.
Second, try to come up with a better categorization of the data into semantic categories.

Approach:  Create and validate 3 different set of NLP machine learning models:
Set 1: A baseline multi-class classification model using a bag-of-word approach, and validating with macro f1-scores.
Set 2: Improve the model using more complex text features, including n-grams, character n-grams and possibly domain-specific features.
Set 3: Clustering: Applying LDA, NMF and K-Means to the whole dataset. Find clusters or topics that match well with some of the ground truth labels. ARI scores are used for comparing different models.
Set 4: Improve the class definition for REQUESTTYPE by using the results of the clustering and results of the previous classification model and apply the topic modeling and clustering techniques.
Set 5: Use a word embedding representation like word2vec
