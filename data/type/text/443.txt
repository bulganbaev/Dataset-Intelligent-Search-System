Chinese-Literature-NER-RE-Dataset
A Discourse-Level Named Entity Recognition and Relation Extraction Dataset  for Chinese Literature Text
We provide a new Chinese literature dataset for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE). The dataset is described at https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.07010.pdf
Tagging Set
We define 7 entity tags and 9 relation tags based on several available NER and RE datasets but with some additional categories specific to Chinese literature text.


Annotation Format
Entity
Each entity is identified by T tag, which takes several attributes.
Id: a unique number identifying the entity within the document. It starts at 0, and is incremented every time a new entity is identified within the same document.
Type: one of the entity tags.
Begin Index: the begin index of an entity. It starts at 0, and is incremented every character.
End Index: the end index of an entity. It starts at 0, and is incremented every character.
Value: words being referred to an identifiable object.
Relation
Each relation is identified by R tag, which can take several attributes:
Id: a unique number identifying the relation within the document. It starts at 0, and is incremented every time a new relation is identified within the same document.
Arg1 and Arg2: two entities associated with a relation.
Type: one of the relation tags.
