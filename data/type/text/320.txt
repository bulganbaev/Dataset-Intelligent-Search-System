DATA-ANALYSIS-ON-AMAZON-FINE-FOOD-REVIEWS-DATASET
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, Data Visualization and Text Featurization (BOW, tfidf, Word2Vec). Build several ML models like KNN, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, etc..
Amazon Food Reviews EDA, NLP and Text Preprocessing
Defined Problem Statement
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on Amazon Fine Food Reviews Dataset plotted Word Clouds, Distplots, Histograms, etc.
Performed Data Cleaning & Data Preprocessing by removing unneccesary and duplicates rows and for text reviews removed html tags, punctuations, Stopwords and Stemmed the words using Porter Stemmer
Documented the concepts clearly
Plotted TSNE plots for Different Featurization of Data viz. BOW(uni-gram,bi-gram), tfidf, Avg-Word2Vec(using Word2Vec model pretrained on Google News) and tf-idf-Word2Vec
