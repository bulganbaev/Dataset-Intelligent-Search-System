Text Classification with CNNs
This code repository implements the neural network and one dataset from
A Sensntivity Analysis (and Practitioners' Guide to) Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification, which are a one-layer CNN and
the Twitter Polarity dataset respectively.
Dependencies

Python 3.5 or greater
Tensorflow 1.0 or greater
easydict

Getting Started
To run the polarity dataset, clone the repo onto your local machine, navigate into the repository,
using the command line/terminal, and type python train-eval.py {argparser flags}.
Replace {argparser flags} with the appropriate choice of options as described in
the section below.
Argparser
The following commandline options are available for running the model:

-n, run_num, default = 0, saves all model files under /save_directory/model_directory/Model[n]
-r, restore, default = 0, binary value indicating whether to restore from a model.
-m, model_restore, default = 1, restores from /save_directory/model_directory/Model[n]
-f, file_epoch, default = 1,  restores model with the following checkpoint: part_[f].ckpt.meta
-t, train, default=1,  # Binary to train model. 0 = No train.
-v, eval, default=1)  # Binary to evalulate model. 0 = No eval.
-g, gpu, default = 0, accepts a single integer or a string "all" to use all available.

Yaml File
Some parameters cannot be adjusted at the commandline; all others are defined in the lib/config.py
file and can be edited with a Yaml file found in the cfgs/ folder. Refer to the OneLayerConv.yml file
for an example of adjusting the number of training epochs.
Adding New Networks and Datasets
New Networks
You can edit the network method of the OneLayerConv class in the lib/networks.py file to change the neural network.
The paper recommends 1-max pooling over other types of pooling but suggests that deeper
networks will yield superior results. You can also add a .yaml file under
the cfgs/ folder if you would like to edit the parameters defined in the
lib/config.py file.
New Datasets
You will have to add a new class in the lib/datasets.py file similar to
the TwitterSentiment class currently implemented. The codebase expects only certain methods
(batch_iter, transform_x, transform_y) to be implemented in
the dataset class, but other methods will be necessary (i.e. load_data).
