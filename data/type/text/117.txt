Try the online IDE!
Overview
Chatito helps you generate datasets for training and validating chatbot models using a simple DSL.
If you are building chatbots using commercial models, open source frameworks or writing your own natural language processing model, you need training and testing examples. Chatito is here to help you.
This project contains the:

Online chatito IDE
Chatito DSL specification
DSL AST parser in pegjs format
Generator implemented in typescript + npm package

Chatito language
For the full language specification and documentation, please refer to the DSL spec document.
Adapters
The language is independent from the generated output format and because each model can receive different parameters and settings, there are 3 data format adapters provided. This section describes the adapters, their specific behaviors and use cases:
Default format
Use the default format if you plan to train a custom model or if you are writing a custom adapter. This is the most flexible format because you can annotate Slots and Intents with custom entity arguments, and they all will be present at the generated output, so for example, you could also include dialog/response generation logic with the DSL. E.g.:
%[some intent]('context': 'some annotation')
    @[some slot] ~[please?]

@[some slot]('required': 'true', 'type': 'some type')
    ~[some alias here]


Custom entities like 'context', 'required' and 'type' will be available at the output so you can handle this custom arguments as you want.
Rasa NLU
Rasa NLU is a great open source framework for training NLU models.
One particular behavior of the Rasa adapter is that when a slot definition sentence only contains one alias, the generated Rasa dataset will map the alias as a synonym. e.g.:
%[some intent]('training': '1')
    @[some slot]

@[some slot]
    ~[some slot synonyms]

~[some slot synonyms]
    synonym 1
    synonym 2

In this example, the generated Rasa dataset will contain the entity_synonyms of synonym 1 and synonym 2 mapping to some slot synonyms.
LUIS
LUIS is part of Microsoft's Cognitive services. Chatito supports training a LUIS NLU model through its batch add labeled utterances endpoint, and its batch testing api.
To train a LUIS model, you will need to post the utterance in batches to the relevant API for training or testing.
Reference issue: #61
Snips NLU
Snips NLU is another great open source framework for NLU. One particular behavior of the Snips adapter is that you can define entity types for the slots. e.g.:
%[date search]('training':'1')
   for @[date]

@[date]('entity': 'snips/datetime')
    ~[today]
    ~[tomorrow]

In the previous example, all @[date] values will be tagged with the snips/datetime entity tag.
NPM package
Chatito supports Node.js v8.11.2 LTS or higher.
Install it globally:
npm i chatito -g

Or locally:
npm i chatito --save

Then create a definition file (e.g.: trainClimateBot.chatito) with your code.
Run the npm generator:
npx chatito trainClimateBot.chatito

The generated dataset should be available next to your definition file.
Here is the full npm generator options:
npx chatito <pathToFileOrDirectory> --format=<format> --formatOptions=<formatOptions> --outputPath=<outputPath> --trainingFileName=<trainingFileName> --testingFileName=<testingFileName>


<pathToFileOrDirectory> path to a .chatito file or a directory that contains chatito files. If it is a directory, will search recursively for all *.chatito files inside and use them to generate the dataset. e.g.: lightsChange.chatito or ./chatitoFilesFolder
<format> Optional. default, rasa or snips
<formatOptions> Optional. Path to a .json file that each adapter optionally can use
<outputPath> Optional. The directory where to save the generated datasets. Uses the current directory as default.
<trainingFileName> Optional. The name of the generated training dataset file. Do not forget to add a .json extension at the end. Uses <format>_dataset_training.json as default file name.
<testingFileName> Optional. The name of the generated testing dataset file. Do not forget to add a .json extension at the end. Uses <format>_dataset_testing.json as default file name.

Notes to prevent overfitting
Overfitting is a problem that can be prevented if we use Chatito correctly. The idea behind this tool, is to have an intersection between data augmentation and a probabilistic description of possible sentences combinations. It is not intended to generate deterministic datasets, you should avoid generating all possible combinations.
