dataset
Description
Repository contains lists of URLs that will help you download NSFW images, this set can be used in building big enough dataset to train robust NSFM classification model.
This work inspired by nsfw_data_scrapper and for downloading images suggested to use scripts from the scrapper.
NOTE

After downloading is highly suggested to clean your dataset, for example:

delete duplicates
remove images that was banned/deleted (they have a special image placeholder)
find out corrupted data and remove it also
etc


Pay attention to noise, some resources provide highly mixed data of NSFW and neutral images
This repository helps in retrieving NSFW images and there's no special URLs for neutral content
