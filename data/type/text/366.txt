MergedSymbolsKannada
Benchmarking dataset of merged symbols in Kannada along with their associated ground truth Unicode text
The GroundTruthUnicode.txt file contains the ground truth Unicode text for each of the test images in TestImages folder.
The following conventions are used in Unicode representation:
A zero-width non-joner (ZWNJ) is used when a pure-consonant needs to be represented in un-modified form. For example,
: ಜೆಟ್‌ನಿ
When a vowel modifier such as anusvara or vowel_sign_ii appear at the beginning of the merged symbol sequence, the ground truth will have the Unicode of that depenent vowel at the beginning. For example:
: ಂದಾದ
 -> ೀಳುತಿದ
An exception to the above rule is for arkaa ottu, which for simplicity, is represented using Kannada digit nine (೯) in the ground truth. For example:
: ೯ಸಂ
