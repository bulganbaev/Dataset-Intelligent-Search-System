Text classification on the famous Imdb dataset on Kaggle.
I have used different approaches:-
1 ) The first approach used is by creating Word Embeddings in Keras using the Embedding layer and training a neural network. The accuracy using this approach is 89.04% after training for 5 epochs.
2 ) The second approach is the traditional Bag-of-Words approach with Tfidf values in the Document-Term-Matrix ( DTM ). This gives an accuracy of 88.68% with the Logistic Regression algo.
3 ) In third approach I have also used the LSTM in Keras to train on the embeddings generated by the Keras embedding layer. This also gives an accurcay of ~90%.
4 ) Lastly I have used the Word2Vec approach. I have implemented them through the Gensim library and then averaged the word vectors to get a embedding or a feature vector a particular document.
Can also try Doc2Vec but that sometimes work inferior to averaged word vectors as mentioned here.
Also this tutorial on Kaggle follows the same averaged w2v approach.
This  discussion on SO also focusses on the same issue.(MUST READ)
Note that since dataset is small the peroformance of neural net ,DL based approaches and BOW approach is comparable.
