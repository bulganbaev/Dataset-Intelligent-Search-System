MNIST-Text-Classification-using-Keras
MNIST is a standard well organised handwritten digit recoginition dataset.
This dataset is very well normalized with minimal noise. It serves as a good data for starting to develop your algorithms in new library.
Here we have performed classification using keras which served a validation accuracy of ~98%.
