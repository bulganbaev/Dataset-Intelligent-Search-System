Basic LDS Scraper
This is a small utility that scrapes the LINZ Data Service and generates a "map" of what's available.
This doesn't actually scrape the data sets themselves though. Just the metadata.
How do I use it?
Assuming you already have Python installed, just run
python scrape.py
and it will generate a file called names.csv
NOTE: At present, since we're learning Python while writing this, it only scrapes the first page, haha...
In future, it should scrape all available pages... It's getting there...
What does the generated CSV contain?
At the moment, it has:



Metadata




Title


Downloads


Views



Future features?
It'd be nice to have include the other metadata like description, last updated etc.
Gotta have the basic features down first.
