OKCupid hacker scripts, data, etc
Tools for crawling OKCupid for users and their profiles.
Pulling Data

FindUsers.py - This will find all the usernames (with age and gender) of current OKC users in the target location, dumping out a csv.
FetchProfiles.py - This takes the usernames csv from FindUsers.py and pulls the profiles one at a time, writing to a new csv.

Analyzing Data

anonymized_profiles.sf.20120630.csv - .csv file containing profile information (from their public profiles on 2012/06/30) for n=59,946 users who

were members on 2012/06/26
were living within 25 miles of San Francisco
were online in the last year
had at least one photo in their profile
Does NOT include essays, personal questions, or any other potentially individually identifiable data


anonymized_usernames.sf.20140218.csv - to study temporal population changes, this is a dataset of just age and gender of users at this point in time (with the same filters as above). Anonymized user ids will map to users in the other file, if the user existed in both.
Analysis.R - R script to read in profile data and

produce a mosaicplot cross-classifying gender and sexual orientation
produce a histogram of heights split by gender


ReadingLevel.py - Tools for determining the reading level of a chunk of text, as well as some useful statistics about a blob (number of words, sentences, syllables, etc). I have used it to compute reading levels for essay responses, plot them, etc, though I don't have any of that code checked in.
cmudict.0.7a.txt - Used by ReadingLevel.py, this is a dictionary mapping words to their numbers of syllables. I pulled it from some CMU page on the interwebs, but I forget where.
