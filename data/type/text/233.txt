Text Mining Example
Text mining that I carried out using python libraries and Jupyter notebook on a large dataset of 24 books.
N.B. The images represent the output from carrying out K-Means and Hierarchical clustering as well as LDA. Unfortunately the actual data I was working with cannot be uploaded here due to the file size limit.
