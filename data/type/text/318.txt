Data mining and modeling from dataset of roughly 35,000 cragslist car postings using regular expressions, text processing, and modeling in ggplot2
For this project I will be extracting several key variables from a dataset containing 35,000 web scraped craigslist vehicle postings
This project is supposed to demonstrate how effective using R one can clean and mine big data for important infomation that isnt outright given, as well as demonstrate text mining as a powerful tool.
The data used can be found in the following link:
