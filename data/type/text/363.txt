IoT Use case Miner
Backend for identification of IoT use cases in massive Twitter datasets using text mining.
Quickstart
Setup dataset

Extract the dataset in tweets.zip from resources/dataset in iot-miner-lib module.
Import the dataset to a new database. A table tweets should be created with around 500000 entries.
Configure database connection in app.properties.

Mine use cases
Run UseCaseIdentifier main method in io-miner-lib module. Default settings should work.
This will perform following operations

Train a model for classification

Prepare training data set and convert it into weka format
Train the model and save it in the file system


Pre-process tweets

Retrieve tweets with related keywords
Clean up tweets that are too short
Discard non-English tweets
Remove near-duplicates (such as re-tweets) using edit-distance
Remove stop words
Perform stemming


Discover IoT use cases using classification

Run weka's J48 algorithm by default (can be easily changed)


Categorize discovered use cases

Use using LDA topic modelling with given number of topics


Save results

Automatically creates two tables industry and use-case
Insert the results into the tables so they can be accessed using rest-api



Deploy backend

Build with maven: mvn install.
Deploy iot-miner.war file in tomcat.
IotMinerApplication can also be run within IDE instead of deploying in a server.

Try out REST-API

After the application is deployed, REST-API documentation can be accessed at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

Try out front-end

Front-end is available here: iotuc-explorer
