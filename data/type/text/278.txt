Markov chain text generator
The Markovgen software is designed to allow you to quickly and easily train a markovchain on a text dataset, and to generate an arbitrary amount of text with the trained model.
How to compile
There is only one code file, main.cpp, to compile it simply clone or download the repository, open a terminal in the repository directory and run g++ main.cpp --std=c++11 -o markovgen. Add -O6 to optimize for speed.
How to use
If you have a textfile data.txt you wish to use to generate text, you can simply run ./markovgen data.txt, and it will use the default parameters and generate a bit of text.
Run ./markovgen -h or ./markovgen --help for more information on what parameters can be set.
