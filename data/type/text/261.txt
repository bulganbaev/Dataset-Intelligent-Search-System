Text Classification Using Naive Bayes Classification
Synopsis
The Naive Bayes Classifier algorithm for Text Classification has been used to create the model. Following are the features of this project -

Pre process the data before entering in to the Naive Bayes Classifier Algorithm. It removes all the stop words and it uses random algorithm to choose 5 classes for training and testing.
The Algorithm will take the created vocabulary.
The Program has 2 broad parts - 1 for Training and 1 for Testing to get the accuracy

Software’s Used
Following are the software’s used to develop this project -

Python 3.6
IDE: PyCharm - Community Edition 2017.2

Following are the Python packages used in the code -

isfile
join
listdir
random
collections
sys
logging
nltk
math

How to Run the Code
Following are the steps to run the code -

Download the project folder - "NaiveBayes" and save in the local
Start PyCharm
Open the project folder selecting the saved project folder.
Preprocessing.py script needs 2 inputs from the user:

Train Dataset Path
Testing Dataset Path


Run the NaiveBayes.py and get the following outputs -

Accuracy



Results
We ran the code multiple times (over 100) for 5 news groups chosen randomly from 20 news groups. All the results are independent and different depends on the randomly chosen 5 classes.
Following is the best result we got :

Class Names: ['talk.politics.guns', 'sci.space', 'rec.autos', 'sci.crypt', 'soc.religion.christian'] ,
Accuracy : 92.25%
