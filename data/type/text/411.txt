ChineseVoice_TextDatasetCreation
Introduction
This is a sub task of my Graduation Project.
This project aims to set up a Chinese Voice-Text Dataset.
The project uses chinese dramas and their subtitles.
Cut the audio of dramas by subtitles to get Voice and Text sentences.
In my graduation project, I set up a dataset including 370000 sentences, 300 hours, 100GB dataset.
I maybe publish this dataset belongs to the condition.
I whish this project and the dataset will help more reasearchers in Chinese Audio Processing and NLP.
Programs
There are 2 C++ programs, 1 Python script, 3 batchfiles, 1 file searching program.


2 C++ programs

BuildCMD_AnalyzeSRT.exe
This program will set up a txt file: AnalyzeSRT_CMD.txt
This txt file includes several commands like this:
AnalyzeSRT.exe "01.mp4.wav" "01.srt"
The txt file will be read by 0.Execute_TXT_CMD.bat in a step and execute all the commands.
AnalyzeSRT.exe

srtparser.h
Please refer to srtparser.h.
Thanks for saurabhshri(Saurabh Shrivastava)'s work!
Main
This program will set up several txt files: xx.txt
xx is the name of video. These txt files include many commands like this:
ffmpeg -y -i "01.mp4.wav" -ss 97.320 -t 1.960 -acodec copy ".\output\在一九九七年.wav"
The project uses FFmpeg to separate audio files.





1 Python script

asstosrt
Please refer to asstosrt.
Thanks for sorz(Shell Chen)'s work!



3 batchfiles

0.Execute_TXT_CMD.bat
This batchfile will execute all txt files in the directory. The txt files including several CMD commands.
1.Separator_xxx_WAV.bat
These batch files(for MKV and MP4) will extract audio files from video filess in the directory.
Please use corresponding batchfile by the format of video you have.
You can also use some other programs like Format Factory to extract audio files.
2.ReplaceFileName.bat

SpecialCharaList.txt
This txt file includes some illegal characters.
We can refer to this to clear up dataset finally.
Main
This batch will delete a character in a file name, like:
我要吃饭!.wav -> 我要吃饭.wav





1 file searching program

Everything
Please refer to Everything.
This program will help you search some files including illegal characters to clear up the dataset.



Execute Steps


Get audio files
Use 1.Seperator_xxx_WAV.bat or other programs to extract audio files from video source files.
Please must set audio file name including video file format(MUST 3 character length). Like this: ABCD.xxx.wav.
For example: 01.mp4.wav


Get subtitles
Please let subtitles' names are as same as video names.
For example, if your video name is 01.mp4, you will get 01.mp4.wav in last step, and you should let your subtitle name is 01.srt.
If your source subtitles' format is *.ass, please use asstosrt to convert *.ass to *.srt.


Cut audio files
NOTICE: Please follow the steps STRICTLY!


Build AnalyzeSRT Commands txt file
Please JUST set [all audio files] and BuildCMD_AnalyzeSRT.exe into a folder.
Run BuildCMD_AnalyzeSRT.exe.
You will get a txt file: AnalyzeSRT_CMD.txt
This file includes several CMD commands like this:
AnalyzeSRT.exe "01.mp4.wav" "01.srt"
NOTICE: Please OPEN AnalyzeSRT_CMD.txt file and CHECK the content. MUST DELETE the lines that are not similar with the EXAMPLE!


Run the commands created in last step
Please JUST set [all audio files], [all srt files], AnalyzeSRT.exe, AnalyzeSRT_CMD.txt, 0.Execute_TXT_CMD.bat into a folder.
Run 0.Execute_TXT_CMD.bat.
You will get several txt files like: xx.txt.
For example, a audio file name is 01.mp4.wav, you will get 01.txt correspondingly.


Cut audio files by run all commands in all txt files
Please JUST set [all audio files], [all txt files created in last step], 0.Execute_TXT_CMD.bat into a folder.
CREATE a empty folder output in this folder.
Run 0.Execute_TXT_CMD.bat.
You will get the outputs in output folder.




Clear up dataset
There are a lot of illegal audio files(including illegal characters, 0KB files, etc.).
Please use SpecialCharaList.txt and ReplaceFileName.bat to rename illegal filenames.
I recommend that you should search illegal characters with Everything at the same time to insure the legality.


FINISH!
