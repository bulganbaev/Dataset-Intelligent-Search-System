Text Sentiment Analyzer
This is a multi layer feed forward neural network for text sentiment classification (positive or negative) trained on 25,000 movie reviews from the IMDB movie reviews website. The dataset also provides another 25,000 samples which we use to validate the model. This example project demonstrates text feature representation and deep learning using a type of neural network classifier called a Multi Layer Perceptron.

Tutorial
Our objective is to predict the sentiment (either positive or negative) of a blob of English text using machine learning. We sometimes refer to this type of machine learning as Natural Language Processing (or NLP for short) because it involves making sense of language. The dataset provided to us contains 25,000 training and 25,000 testing samples each consisting of a blob of English text describing a movie review from the IMDB website. The samples have been pre labeled either positive or negative. In this tutorial we'll use the IMDB dataset to train a multi layer neural network to analyze the sentiment of text that we feed it.
Training
Before we dive into the architecture of the network, let's first take care of loading the provided dataset into a Labeled dataset object. The samples are given to us in .txt files and organized into pos and neg folders. We'll use PHP's built in glob() function to loop through all the text files in each folder and add their contents to a samples array. We'll also add positive and negative labels to the dataset as a training signal.

Note: The source code can be found in the train.php file in the project root.

use Rubix\ML\Datasets\Labeled;

$samples = $labels = [];

foreach (glob(__DIR__ . '/train/pos/*.txt') as $file) {
        $samples[] = [file_get_contents($file)];
        $labels[] = 'positive';
}

foreach (glob(__DIR__ . '/train/neg/*.txt') as $file) {
        $samples[] = [file_get_contents($file)];
        $labels[] = 'negative';
}

$training = new Labeled($samples, $labels);
Since neural nets understand numbers but the features given to us are in raw text format, we'll need to convert them to continuous values in order for the network to understand and train effectively. We do so bu implementing a transformer pipeline consisting of an HTML Stripper, Text Normalizer, Word Count Vectorizer, TF-IDF Transformer, and Z Scale Standardizer. If you are unfamiliar with transformer pipelines see the Credit Card Default tutorial for an introduction to the Pipeline wrapper.
The Word Count Vectorizer is a common bag of words feature extractor that uses a fixed vocabulary and term counts to denote words that appear in a particular document. We elect to limit the vocabulary to 10,000 of the most frequent words that satisfy the criteria of appearing in at least 3 different documents. In this way, we limit the amount of noise words that enter the training set. Another common text feature representation are TF-IDF values which take the term counts from Word Count Vectorizer and weight them by their inverse document frequencies (IDFs) which can be interpreted as their importance within the text corpus. Specifically, higher weight is given to words that are more rare within the corpus.
The next thing we need to do is define the architecture of the network's hidden layers as the first hyper-parameter of the Multi Layer Perceptron base estimator. Each of the 5 hidden layers consist of a Dense layer of neurons and a non-linear Activation layer with optional Batch Norm for normalizing the activations. The first 3 hidden layers use a Leaky ReLU activation function while the last 2 use a parametric form of the Leaky ReLU called PReLU (for Parametric Rectified Linear Unit). We've found that this architecture works pretty well for this problem but feel free to experiment and come up with your own.

Note: For this tutorial, the "depth" of the hidden layers is distinguished as the number of weight layers which include the five Dense hidden layers and the output layer.

$estimator = new PersistentModel(
    new Pipeline([
        new HTMLStripper(),
        new TextNormalizer(),
        new WordCountVectorizer(10000, 3, new NGram(2, 2)),
        new TfIdfTransformer(),
        new ZScaleStandardizer(),
    ], new MultiLayerPerceptron([
        new Dense(100),
        new Activation(new LeakyReLU()),
        new Dense(100),
        new BatchNorm(),
        new Activation(new LeakyReLU()),
        new Dense(100),
        new Activation(new LeakyReLU()),
        new Dense(70),
        new BatchNorm(),
        new PReLU(),
        new Dense(50),
        new PReLU(),
    ], 100, new AdaMax(0.0005))),
    new Filesystem(MODEL_FILE, true)
);
Observe the general pattern to the hidden layers of the network. Dense layers linearly transform the input, then an Activation layer applies a non-linear transformation, and the process repeats. Optionally we add  Batch Normalization as a method to speed up training and to prevent overfitting. For the activations we are using two different types of Activation layers with the Leaky ReLU activation function. The last two hidden layers use a parametric form of the Leaky ReLU (called PReLU) that learns the optimal amount of leakage to apply during training. Refer to the API Reference on hidden layers for further reading.
The remaining hyper-parameters batch size, optimizer, and learning rate can now be set. Batch size determines the number of training samples to run through the network at one time. The Gradient Descent optimizer determines the step size for each parameter in the network and most optimizers allow you to set a learning rate which controls the master step size. When setting the learning rate of an Optimizer, the important thing to note is that a learning rate that is too low will train slowly while a rate that is too high will prevent the network from learning at all. For the full list of hyper-parameters, check out the Multi Layer Perceptron API reference.
Lastly, we'll wrap the entire Pipeline in a Persistent Model wrapper so we can save and load it later in a different process.
Now call train() with the training dataset we instantiated earlier to train the network.
$estimator->train($training);
Here is an example of the training loss and validation score look like when plotted in a chart.

Finally, we save the model so we can use it later in our other scripts.
$estimator->save();
To run the training script from the project root:
$ php train.php
Prediction
Now we'll build a simple script that takes some text input from the terminal and outputs a sentiment prediction using the estimator we've just trained.

Note: The source code can be found in the predict.php file in the project root.

To load the trained MLP classifier, we need to tell Persistent Model where the model is located in storage with a Persister object. Persisters can be thought of as the storage driver used to persist the model.
use Rubix\ML\PersistentModel;
use Rubix\ML\Persisters\Filesystem;

$estimator = PersistentModel::load(new Filesystem('sentiment.model'));
Next, we'll use the build in PHP function readline() to prompt the user to enter some text and put the single sample in an Unlabeled dataset object.
use Rubix\ML\Datasets\Unlabeled;

$text = readline('Enter some text to analyze: ');

$dataset = Unlabeled::build([$text]);
Finally, we pass the dataset to the proba() method on the estimator to return an array of class probability estimates per sample and dump the first one.
$probabilities = $estimator->proba($dataset);

var_dump($probabilities[0]);
To run the prediction script from the project root:
$ php predict.php
You should see a prompt that looks something like this. If so, give it a try by entering a sentence or two.
$ php predict.php

...
Enter text to analyze: 
Cross Validation
To test the generalization performance of the trained network we'll use the testing samples provided to us to generate predictions and then analyze them compared to their ground-truth labels with a cross validation (CV) report. We do not use any training data for cross validation because we want to test the model on data it has never seen before.

Note: The source code can be found in the validate.php file in the project root.

We'll start by importing the testing samples like we did with the training samples. This time, however, we're only going to use a subset of the testing data to generate the report. After we build the dataset we call randomize() and take() to create a testing set containing 10,000 random samples.
use Rubix\ML\Datasets\Labeled;

$samples = $labels = [];

foreach (glob(__DIR__ . '/test/pos/*.txt') as $file) {
        $samples[] = [file_get_contents($file)];
        $labels[] = 'positive';
}

foreach (glob(__DIR__ . '/test/neg/*.txt') as $file) {
        $samples[] = [file_get_contents($file)];
        $labels[] = 'negative';
}

$testing = Labeled::build($samples, $labels)->randomize()->take(10000);
Again, we use the Persistent Model wrapper to load the network we trainied earlier and then use it to make predictions on the testing set. The predict() method takes the testing set as input and returns an array of class predictions (positive or negative).

Note: Unlike the proba() method, which outputs the probability scores for each label, the predict() method only outputs the predicted class label.

use Rubix\ML\PersistentModel;
use Rubix\ML\Persisters\Filesystem;

$estimator = PersistentModel::load(new Filesystem('sentiment.model'));

$predictions = $estimator->predict($testing);
The last step is to generate the report and write it to a JSON file. The report we'll generate is actually a combination of two reports (Multiclass Breakdown and Confusion Matrix). We wrap each report in an Aggregate Report such to generate all reports at once. The Multiclass Breakdown will give us detailed information about the performance of the estimator broken down by class. The Confusion Matrix will give us an idea as to what labels the estimator is "confusing" for another. See the API Reference for more information.
use Rubix\ML\CrossValidation\Reports\AggregateReport;
use Rubix\ML\CrossValidation\Reports\ConfusionMatrix;
use Rubix\ML\CrossValidation\Reports\MulticlassBreakdown;

$report = new AggregateReport([
    new MulticlassBreakdown(),
    new ConfusionMatrix(),
]);

$results = $report->generate($predictions, $testing->labels());
Now take a look at the report file in your favorite editor and see how well it performed. Our tests using the network architecture in this tutorial scores about 85% accurate. See if you can score higher by tuning the hyper-parameters or with a different architecture.
To run the validation script from the project root:
$ php validate.php
