Credit
Credit for TextDNA belongs to Danielle Albers Szafir (danielle.szafir@colorado.edu), who originally developed the program and website documentation under the guidance of Michael Gleicher and Robin Valenza. The TextDNA user interface was further developed by Yusef Sohail under the direction of Szafir. The two fine-tuned the system for raw text in consultation with Deidre Stuffer, who provided documentation for raw text manipulation and generated the test dataset with documentation to help users learn TextDNA functions. Erin Winter provided scripts to generate csv datasets from plaintext input for the public release. The Docker container for data generation was made by Janneke van der Zwaan.
