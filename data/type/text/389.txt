Latin Text Dataset
28.7 million+ character dataset containing latin texts for machine learning, language generation  and analysation.
About
This is a small snippet of what the dataset looks like:
Cum venisset accitus praedicto die, advocato omni quod aderat commilitio, tribunali ad altiorem
suggestum erecto, quod aquilae circumdederunt et signa, Augustus insistens eumque manu retinens
dextera, haec sermone placido peroravit: Adsistimus apud illos, optimi rei publicae defensores, 
causae communi uno paene omnium spiritu vindicandae, quam acturus tamquam apud aequos iudices.

As you can see it's all authentic latin written in the roman times by historic figures such as: Ceasar, Augustus and many many more.
There are still certain kinks I have not been able to resolve such as the occasional title or capitalised roman numeral, but because the dataset is so large it shouldn't make a difference as its result is diluted enough for LSTM's (or GRU's) not to pick up on them.
All data and text originates from thelatinlibrary.com which is to my knowledge in public domain.
Getting Started
You can either use the pre-scraped and pre-processed file called latincorpus.txt or run / modify the main.py file and configure it to your liking! Scraping all the text data takes about 3-5 minutes on a computer with a moderately fast cpu and ethernet connection.
Prerequisites
The following libraries are required to run main.py, to install these automatically go to Installing down below.
selenium==3.141.0
beautifulsoup4==4.7.1
tqdm==4.31.1

Installing
To install the python libraries described above execute this command:
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
