Dependencies and Installation


Code for Sketchguess is based on Lasagne\Theano. This code was tested on UBUNTU 14.04 on the folowing NVIDIA GPUs: NVIDIA TITAN X.


Download CNN features that are input to the LSTM, Word2Vec dicitonary and dataset,
Instructions are available here.


To test on the Sketchguess recurrent on trained model:
$ git clone https://github.com/val-iisc/sketchguess.git 
$ bash models/download_models.sh
$ bash src/run_model.sh


The predictions of the Sketchguess recurrent model can be viewed in the log file : out/machine_generated_guesses.log .


The embedding representations regressed by the lstm model are stored in : out/pred_release.npz . This file is used to generate the      machine guesses via a KNN-search of "data/all_w2v.mat".


Q&A


If automatic download of pre-trained models fail, you can find instructions for manual download here.
