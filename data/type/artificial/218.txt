Image Classifier Project.ipynb : Jupyter notebook
Image Classifier Project.html : html export of the Jupyter notebook
train.py : to train a network on a dataset
predict.py : to predict flower name from an image
imported_packages.py : the packages used in the other python files
model.py : functions and classes relating to the model
