 cnn based real time handwritten digit rcognition the objective of this project is to recognize handwritten digits based on real time image acquisition from camera currently several algorithms are suitable for this classification task such as bag of words approach decision trees or artificial neural networks ann however the most powerful image recognition tools are based on convolutional neural network cnn which is going to be the approach chosen for this project matlab scripts were used along with image recognition toolbox for training and testing mnist dataset was used the final net achieved 98 54 train accuracy and 98 40 test accuracy for real time segmentation blob analysis was carried out and for digit preprocessing resize and gauss filter were used to adequate each detected digit to cnn input the final model was tested in 1280x720 webcam with sample time of 1 sec functions loadmnistlabels load mnist labels one label per image loadmnistimages load mnist 28x28 images imgsquarebin reshape binary image into squared imgnormalize normalize image values within 0 to 255 imgblobdetect extract blob objects from image as 4 matrix of images and assigns bounding box output images are ready to be tested on cnn only uint8 input images main files main_cnn_custom_train main_webcam_video
