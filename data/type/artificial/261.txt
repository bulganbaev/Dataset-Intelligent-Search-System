 teach neural network to read handwriting abstract have created handwritten digit recognition using machine learning neural networks and deep learning are two success stories in modern artificial intelligence they ve led to major advances in image recognition automatic text generation and even in self driving cars to get involved with this exciting field you should start with manageable dataset the mnist handwritten digit classification challenge is the classic entry point image data is generally harder to work with than flat relational data the mnist data is beginner friendly and is small enough to fit on one computer handwriting recognition doesn need high computational power used random forest for it what is random forest random forests or random decision forests are an ensemble learning method for classification regression and other tasks that operate by constructing multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes classification or mean prediction regression of the individual trees random decision forests correct for decision trees habit of overfitting to their training set the first algorithm for random decision forests was created by tin kam ho using the random subspace method which in ho formulation is way to implement the stochastic discrimination approach to classification proposed by eugene kleinberg an extension of the algorithm was developed by leo breiman and adele cutler and random forests is their trademark the extension combines breiman bagging idea and random selection of features introduced first by ho and later independently by amit and geman in order to construct collection of decision trees with controlled variance where we use random forest the random forest algorithm is used in lot of different fields like banking stock market medicine and commerce in banking it is used for example to detect customers who will use the bank services more frequently than others and repay their debt in time why used random forest the accuracy score is the only true measure of their relative performance though there may be prior art that indicates which type of classifier from the many available might be better on your type of data if you are lucky random forest classifier 96 82 would say the choice depends very much on what data you have and what is your purpose few rules of thumb random forest works well with mixture of numerical and categorical features when features are on the various scales it is also fine roughly speaking with random forest you can use data as they are svm maximizes the margin and thus relies on the concept of distance between different points it is up to you to decide if distance is meaningful as consequence one hot encoding for categorical features is must do further min max or other scaling is highly recommended at preprocessing step requirements python 3 5 scikit learn latest version numpy mkl for windows matplotlib scipy usage download the four mnist dataset files from this link http yann lecun com exdb mnist unzip and place the files in the dataset folder inside the mnist_dataset_loader folder under each ml algorithm folder e knn _ mnist_dataset_loader _ dataset _ train images idx3 ubyte _ train labels idx1 ubyte _ t10k images idx3 ubyte _ t10k labels idx1 ubyte do for rfc folders and you should be good to go 3 to run the code navigate to one of the directories for which you want to run the code using command prompt cd 1 random forest classifier and then run the file rfc py as follows python rfc py this will run the code and all the print statements will be logged into the summary log file note if you want to see the output to print on the command prompt just comment out line 16 17 18 106 and 107 and hence you will get all the prints on the screen alternatively you can also use pycharm to run the code and run the py file in there 4 to run the code you don need to provide in the mnist dataset as it ll be downloaded automatically or download it from http yann lecun com exdb mnist advantage 1 open source and continously developed 2 good visualization tools 3 scalability and portability 4 steeper learning curve to become good at it 5 implies solid knowledge of math screenshots they are present above in files named as follow graphical result png code output png note as the size of file of mnist file was big so cannot ne uploaded here please download it from the given link above
