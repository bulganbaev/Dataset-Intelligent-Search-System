Digit-Recognition
Objective: To Train a Neural Network with one Hidden Layer using Back-Propogation Algorithm Such that it is capable of recognition Handwritten Digits.
We have used MNSIT Handwritten digit dataset mnsit_all.mat that contains 60K training and 10K testing examples of handwritten digits. Each example in the dataset is represented ny 784 features corroponding to (28 * 28) pixel values ([0,255]). The classes are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 corresponding to each digit.
Accuracy Achieved
Percentage of Total Accuracy = 97
Percentage of Accuracy of 0 = 98.5714
Percentage of Accuracy of 1 = 98.6784
Percentage of Accuracy of 2 = 96.9961
Percentage of Accuracy of 3 = 96.9307
Percentage of Accuracy of 4 = 96.945
Percentage of Accuracy of 5 = 96.6368
Percentage of Accuracy of 6 = 96.7641
Percentage of Accuracy of 7 = 97.2763
Percentage of Accuracy of 8 = 95.0719
Percentage of Accuracy of 9 = 95.8375
Module wise explanation
mnist_all.mat : It is your dataset required for processing.
data_epoc200.mat : Preprocessed data uptill 200 epocs or 200 Iterations.
Visualization.m : Used for visualizing images.
main.m : Used for calling initilazition.m, running epocs i.e. training the neural network using training.m and for calculating the accuracy of the neural network using Accuracy.m
initilization.m : Used for loading mnist_all.mat, initilizing weights, bias and target and calculating the sizes of dataset
training.m : Used for training the neural network. For converting image to black and white binary_convertor.mis used and for training processing.m is used.
binary_convertor.m : Used to convert image to black and white or the binary format.
processing.m : Used for finding the feed forward and then back propogating the neural network. sigm.m is used to find the symbodial values of the input matrix.
Accuracy.m : Used to calculate the accuracy of the neural network. prediction.m is used to predict the digit.
prediction.m : It is used to feed forward the neural network and predict the digit.
