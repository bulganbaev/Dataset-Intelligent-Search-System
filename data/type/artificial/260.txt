methods 3 4 outputs 4 references 1 overview mtgipick is software that implements multiscale statistical algorithm to predict genomic islands gis from single genome it uses small scale test with large scale features to score small region deviating from the host and large scale statistical test with small scale features to identify multi window segments for identification of gis mtgipick can identify gis from single genome without annotated information of genomes or prior knowledge from other datasets in simulations with alien fragments from artificial and real genomes mtgipick reported robust results across different experiments from real biological data mtgipick demonstrated better performance compared with existing methods and identified gis with more accurate size mtgipick was written in matlab and java compiled in windows and linux and run on those platforms we have supplied version of mtgipick the output of mtgipick consists of genomic signatures conserved score of each predicted gis and predicted gis in addition mtgipick provides new interactive genome visualization tool which uses zoomable sunburst and sunburst partition to represent predicted gis with conserved scores along the whole genome mtgipick version 1 2 0 has been released with some new features the input format follows the standard fasta format multiple dna sequences are supported the file suffix is recommended to be fasta or fa the uploading progress is monitored using progress bar new options to process the input file is added the software efficiency has been improved reduce parameter selection on prediction warning messages are added to notify the users when anything wrong occurs output file is more readable and more details an interactive visualization tool is added for predicted genomic islands along the whole genome contact daiailiu04 yahoo com 2 obtain and install 2 1 requirements mtgipick has been compiled and tested under sun java interpreter and matlab mtgipick can be used in

from ncbi be sure to save them as fasta format first sequence format conversion tools are available at http www ebi ac uk tools sfc the sequences can be uploaded to mtgipick in file it is very important that each of the sequences has unique name if they do not the software will fail there must be no empty lines white spaces or control characters between sequences or at the top of the file this will also cause the software to fail 3 2 2 process input file there will be an upload progress bar to monitor upload progress when clicking the button to upload file if the input file you uploaded contains at least two sequences dialog box appears to tell you to select way to process the input file predict each sequence separately for each dna sequence of the input file mtgipick will process it separately and predict its gis assemble and predict the sequences from the input file are assembled into sequence according to the order of these sequences in the input file and mtgipick will process it as sequence and predict its gis 3 3 methods 3 3 1 ist lfs method framework ist lfs is proposed small scale test with large scale feature selection that was used to quantify the compositional differences of region from the host in the mtgipick it is efficient at detecting horizontal gene transfers or gis with small sizes the steps are described below split genome into non overlapping windows of size 1kb calculate the frequencies of the tetranucleotides in each window as genomic signatures extract the signatures of the host with the help of the confidence intervals on the windows variances calculate the kurtosis of each tetranucleotide across windows and select the windows with larger kurtosis as informative signatures measure the divergence of the ith window from the host using the two sample test select windows whose scores are large enough to be considered to be statistically significant delete the selected windows and update all of windows of the genome then repeat steps f until there is no window to be found refine the boundaries of the predicted gis using the cg mjsd method 2 parameters of ist lfs software word size the length of mer and default is 4 windowed transform the total number of the windows used in genomic transformation and default is 1 iteration time the periods of time that are repeated to select windows whose scores are large enough to be considered statistically significant and default is 5 core feature size the size of selected features by the proposed kurtosis and default is 256 eye window size the size of eye windows used in the proposed divergence measure based on two sample test and default is 2 time standard error the standard deviation of the mean of the window scores to select windows associated with putative gis and default is 0 05 upstream downstream of raw gis the length of sequences around raw gis to refine the boundaries of predicted gis and default is 5kb 3 3 2 mtgipick method framework mtgipick is novel method for the robust identification of gis using the multiscale statistical testing the steps are described below split genome into non overlapping windows of size 1kb calculate the frequencies of the tetranucleotides in each window as genomic signatures at smaller scale we propose an iteration of small scale tests with large scale feature selection ist lfs to quantify the compositional differences of region from the host at large scale we investigated the variability of genomic signals and used multiscale segmentation algorithm msa to identify large multi window segments calculate conserved score of each nucleotide according to the total number of appearances in the selected segments from which gis are detected with respect to their conserved scores refine the boundaries of the predicted genomic islands using the cg mjsd method 2 parameters of mtgipick software word size the length of mer and default is 4 windowed transform the total number of the windows used in genomic transformation and default is 4 iteration time the periods of time that are repeated to select windows whose scores are large enough to be considered statistically significant and default is 5 core feature size the size of selected features by the proposed kurtosis and default is 256 eye window size the size of eye windows used in the proposed divergence measure based on two sample test and default is 5 time standard error the standard deviation of the mean of the window scores to select windows associated with putative gis and default is 0 05 total scale the total number of the scales in the multiscale segmentation algorithm and default is 45 minimum gi size the minimum size of predicted genomic islands and default is 10kb smaller value is recommended if you want to predict gis with small size time standard error the standard deviation of the mean of enrichment scores to select segments associated with putative gis and default is 0 3 upstream downstream of raw gis the length of sequences around raw gis to refine the boundaries of predicted gis and default is 5kb 3 4 results 3 4 1 outputs dialog box appears to tell you to select way to download the results once your
