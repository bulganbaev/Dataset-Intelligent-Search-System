With the computer games evolving continuously  and  rapidly  over  the  years  in  terms  of  their complexity    and    audiovisual    qualities,    the    game    AI (Artificial  Intelligence)  has  been  largely  neglected.  The recent  study  made  by  the  game  design  companies  show that  the  quality  of  the  game  AI  sets  the  game  apart  from the  other  mediocre  games.  There  is  an  essential  need  to develop  a  gaming  model  that  can  generate  an  engaging and  realistic  experience  for  the  player  by  creating  more challenges which can avoid making the player bored if it’s too easy or frustrating if it is too hard. The personalized user  content  generation  in  games  would  increase  the  self-motivation  in  players  as  they  deeply  immerse  themselves into  the  virtual  gaming  world.  An  adaptive  user  model  is necessary to capture the skills of the player and make use of  an  automatic  game  content  altering  algorithm  to  meet the needs of the player by capturing the player’s game logs and analyzing them. In this report, I summarize the World of Warcraft Avatar History dataset which is a public asset of  the  research  community,  comprising  of  attributes  like level,  race,  class,  location,  social  guild  and  understand  the gameplay  behaviour,  interactions,  predict  why  the  users are  unsubscribing  from  the  game  using  Deep  Learning and  enhance  the  game  AI  on  generating  user-tailored contents like bonus levels using the results.
