Aggression_Detection
The attached code and datasets were developed as a part of the Microsoft ASI (Artificial Social Intelligence) Workshop 2017. The code helps detect types of aggression in Hindi-English code-mixed data.
The analysis is done at 4 levels :
Aggressive--------------Non Aggressive (2 class)
|				                    |
|				                    |
|				                    END
Covert/Overt/Non Aggressive
(3 class)
|
|
|
Curse Abuse/Not Curse Abuse
(2 class)
|
|
|
Types of threat- Non threatening/
Physical threat/Sexual threat/
Identity threat  (5 class)
|
|
|
END
Hindi-English code-mixed data from Twitter and Facebook was used for training the 4 stage classifier. Annotations were obtained from crowd-flower. Tagged Data sets can be found in the 'Dataset' folder.
