Conversational Search
Truly Conversational Search is the next logic step in the journey to generate intelligent and useful AI. To understand what this may mean, researchers have voiced a continuous desire to study how people currently converse with search engines.
Introduction
Traditionally, the desire to produce such a comprehensive dataset has been limited because those who have this data (Search Engines) have a responsibility to their users to maintain their privacy and cannot share the data publicly in a way that upholds the trusts users have in the Search Engines. Given these two powerful forces we believe we have a dataset and paradigm that meets both sets of needs: A artificial public dataset that approximates the true data and an ability to evaluate model performance on the real user behavior. What this means is we released a public dataset which is generated by creating artificial sessions using embedding similarity and will test on the original data. To say this again: we are not releasing any private user data but are releasing what we believe to be a good representation of true user interactions.
Corpus Generation
To generate our projection corpus, we took the 1,010,916 MSMARCO queries and generated the query vectors for each unique queries. Once we had these embedding spaces, we build an Approximate Nearest Neighbor Index using ANNOY.
Next, we sampled our Bing usage log from 2018-06-01 to 2018-11-30 to find a sample of sessions that that had more than 1 query, shared a query that had a query embedding similar to a MSMARCO query, and were likely to be conversational in nature. Next we remove all navigation, bot, junk, and adult sessions. Once we did this, we now had 45,040,730 unique user sessions of 344,147 unique queries. The average session was 2.6 queries long and the longest session was 160 queries. Just like we did for our public queries, we generated embedding for each unique query. Finally, in order to merge the two, for each unique session we perform a nearest neighbor search given the real queries query vector in the MSMARCO ANN Index. This allows us to join the public queries to the private sessions generating an artificial user session grounded in true user behavior.
An example of these search sessions is below.

We first release BERT Based Sessions and Query Embedding Based Sessions which we shared with a small group of researchers to get feedback on what worked better. Based on community feedback and data exploration our we are releasing our first full scale dataset described below.

Split the 45,040,730 artificial sessions into a train, dev and test. To do so, any session that included a query from the QnA eval set was considered eval and the remaining sessions were split 90%/10% between train and dev. These files are called full_marco_sessions_ann_split.* and have the following sizes

spacemanidol@spacemanidol:/mnt/c/Users/dacamp/Desktop$ wc -l full_marco_sessions_ann_split.*
   3656706 full_marco_sessions_ann_split.dev.tsv
   8480280 full_marco_sessions_ann_split.test.tsv
  32903744 full_marco_sessions_ann_split.train.tsv
  45040730 total


Use the query vectors to generate a similairty score between edges and filter out four types of edges

Topic Change: (cosine similarity) <= 0.4
Explore: (cosine similarity) \in (0.4, 0.7]
Specify: (cosine similarity) \in (0.7, 0.85]
Paraphrase: (cosine similarity) \in (0.85, 1]


Filter by session coherence

treat "topic change" as non-related and no edge,
build the graph in each session,
pick the biggest sub-graph in the session,
throw away the rest queries not in the biggest sub-graph


Filter by session length removing anything with less than 4 queries.
Filter any session where the chain of queries were just paraphrases

Upon doing this, we have 3 sets of files: Train,Dev, and eval. We are not currently sharing eval. Explicit size numbers below
    75193 marco_ann_session.dev.all.tsv
   774724 marco_ann_session.test.all.tsv
   675334 marco_ann_session.train.all.tsv
  1525251 total

To provide more exploratory content, we further filter the sessions in each split(Train, Dev, Eval) using three types of filtering:

".half_trans.jsonl": half (explore|specifiy) >= 50% adjacent edges in (0.4, 0.85]
".half_explore.jsonl": half (explore): >= 50% adjacent edges in (0.4, 0.7]
".half_specify.jsonl": half (specifiy): >= 50% adjacent edges in (0.7, 0.85]

Explicit size numbers below

Corpus task
We are currently assembling baselines and building an evaluation framework but the initial task will be as follows: Given a chain of queries q1, q2,...,q(n-1) predict q(n). Ideally systems will train and test on the public artificial and will be evaluated on both the private real data and public artificial eval data.

Generate BERT Query Embeddings
To generate our Query Embeddings we used BERT As A Service to generate a unique query embedding for each query in our set. If you want to go ahead and regenerate embeddings(or use it to generate another alternate query source for you model) you can follow what we did below.

cd Data/BERT
pip install bert-serving-server  # server
pip install bert-serving-client  # client, independent of `bert-serving-server`
