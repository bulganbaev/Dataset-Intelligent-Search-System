 automatic attendance management system automatic attendance management system will replace the manual method which takes lot of time and is difficult to maintain there are many bio metric processes in that face recognition is the best method in our campus staff attendance is taken with the help of gesture recognition attendance sheet we can take this to next level by implementing artificial intelligence based face recognition using convolution neural network cnn we have to train our neural net using coco large image dataset designed for object detection and staff dataset several images of individual staffs since we don have the photos of the staffs we have trained our neural net using our own photos our neural net consists of 20 neurons in the hidden layer which help us to diagnose the pixels of the image and compares the result with the trained dataset by using our advanced system the staffs can use their own mobile laptop camera for registering their presence in their own place which is possible only if they are connected to our college network wifi dependencies to install pip install pillow opencv2 tensorflow anaconda spyder jupyter notebook
