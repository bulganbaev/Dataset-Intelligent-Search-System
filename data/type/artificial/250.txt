Major-Project
Machine Learning is a vast field and has provided solutions to many. It even lays feet in the world of stock market as many brokers use Machine Learning algorithms to predict the value of the stock client wants to invest in. The project tends to show which of the algorithms or their hybrids are best for stock predictions.  The project covers algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest Regression, Artificial Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks. There are various research papers for stock predictions using Artificial Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks, but the classical algorithms are not used, so it will reflect the results of those algorithms as well.  The purpose of the project is to analyze the machine learning algorithms on the large dataset of different stock prices and their categories in training set part of dataset to predict the prices of stock, so that we can decrease human effort in deciding the prices of stock and come up with better guidance in order to help people to decide which stock to invest in so as to maximize the return and also to know which algorithm or hybrid of various algorithms gives a better prediction result.
