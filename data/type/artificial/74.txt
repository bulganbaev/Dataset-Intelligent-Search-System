Artificial-Neural-Network
Developed for a school project. It uses the UCI Machine Learning Poker Dataset (link below) to train and test an Artificial Neural Network. The ANN predicts the ranking of a poker hand given a data set. The output is currently incorrect, but all aspects of an Artificial Neural Network are included.
