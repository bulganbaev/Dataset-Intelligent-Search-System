Credit Card Fraud Detection
In this project I'm trying to use machine learning to identify the fraud transactions from a given set of transactions.
Platform Used
IPython Notebook
Dataset
The dataset I'm going to use can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/dalpozz/creditcardfraud. The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.
Requirements
Dillinger uses a number of python libraries to work properly:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
scipy
tensorflow
sklerarn
pylab
keras
seaborn

Execution

Download dataset file named creditcard.csv into a directory named data/ inside project directory.
Open CreditCardFraudDetection.ipynb using jupyter notebook.
