The AsteroFLAG Artificial Data Generator 3 (AADG3)
AADG3 simulates lightcurves of solar-like oscillators.  It is based on
a series of programs derived from the original work by Chaplin et
al. (1997), which describes the method of generating the
oscillations using the Laplace transform solution of a damped harmonic
oscillator.  The use of a correlated excitation component to produce
mode asymmetry was introduced by Toutain et al. (2006).  Most
recently, Howe et al. (2015) gave a detailed description of the
code's methods as part of their validation of BiSON results.
Variants of the code have been used by the Solar Fitting at Low
Angular Degree (solarFLAG, e.g. Chaplin et al. 2006) and
subsequent Asteroseismic Fitting at Low Angular Degree (asteroFLAG,
e.g. Chaplin et al. 2008) consortia.
This version is derived from code delivered as version 2, which we
incremented to the present version.  We publicly released the code as
part of Ball et al. (2018), in which we also presented a large
catalogue of mock TESS targets for which we generated data using
AADG3.
