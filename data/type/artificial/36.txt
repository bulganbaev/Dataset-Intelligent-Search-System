This repo contains our team submission to: https://www.kaggle.com/c/f2018-hand-drawn-pictures
Technologies used: SciKit Learn, OpenCV, Keras
OpenCV was used primarily to reduce image noise
SciKit Learn was used to fit linear baselines to measure performance
Keras was used to apply Deep Learning to the denoised images for classification
File Breakdown
KaggleProject.ipynb: Contains our best performing deep learning model as well data preprocessing steps to reduce image noise.
Neural-Network.ipynb: Contains a hand implemented fully connected feed forward neural network that is used to classify images.
Linear-SVM.ipynb: Contains benchmarking used to determine performance of preprocessing and give baselines to compare our deep learning solutions to.
