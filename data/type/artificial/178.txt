M23COM - Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks on CIFAR-10
The project was done for Artificial Neural Networks module at Coventry University.
The results of running the models can be viewed directly in the hosted Jupyter Notebook files.
The repository includes:

Decoder - set of functions that are required for decoding and fetching the dataset into the IPython notebook
cifar10_dataset - folder with the CIFAR-10 dataset. The content of this folder can be also downloaded from the official website of the CIFAR-10 dataset
Python script of a simple CNN in Jupyter Notebook
Python script of improved CNNs in Jupyter Notebook
Model files of saved models - files with .h5 extension
Presentation - .pdf document of a presentation given at Coventry University
Report - .pdf document in IEEE format
