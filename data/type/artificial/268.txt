 spam classifier based on machine learning concepts it uses artificial neural network model it preprocess data by lower casing stripping html normalizing urls normalizing email addresses normalizing numbers word stemming removal of non words trained classifier to classify whether given email is spam 1 or non spam 0 in particular it converted each email into feature vector r then developed predefined vocabulary list which matches indices with the spam mail and stores the indices in vector and makes the feature i 0 1 for an email corresponds to whether the th word in the dictionary occurs in the email that is i 1 if the th word is in the email and i 0 if the th word is not present in the email the neural network used here was 5 layer neural network deep neural network with the activation functions such as relu for first four layer and sigmoid for the last layer after loading the dataset it will proceed to train our neural network to classify between spam 1 and non spam 0 emails once the training completes saw that the classifier gets training accuracy of about 90 8 and test accuracy of about 88 5 further hyperparameter tuning can stretch the accuracy to more than 95
