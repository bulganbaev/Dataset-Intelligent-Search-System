This artificial neural network (coded in python) has been built and tuned to classify the highest risk customers based on a sample dataset of 10000.
The goal is to determine the cause of their high churn rate; however, it can also be used to determine whether certain individuals should be granted loans, should be approved for credit, may have fraudulent transactions, etc.
