Natural language processing, or NLP as a branch of artificial intelligence (AI), has found many important applications in human daily life. In particular, it has improved ways that computers and humans interact. In this report, we investigate some connections between NLP and business by analyzing a dataset of 1525 negative reviews given by customers of low-rated McDonald’s fast-food restaurants in the United States. The reviews are labeled by one or several labels from eight categories. We build a model to classify each review to the most appropriate category. At the end, we evaluate our model performance by considering its accuracy and confusion matrix.
