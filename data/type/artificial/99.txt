Digit-Recognition
Artificial Neural Network for recognizing a handwritten digit from MNIST dataset
The MNIST dataset contains images of 28*28 pixels. It contains training data of around 60k size and testing data of around 10k
Can be downloaded from (http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~roweis/data/mnist_all.mat)
The neural network has 784 neurons in the hidden layer and 10 in the ouput layer
The network has been trained using Back Propagation Algorithm
The network achieves an accuracy of about 96%
