Calculating the slump flow of high performance concrete using regularized and unregularized regression techniques. I have used the HPC dataset available on the UCI machine learning repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Concrete+Slump+Test).
The paper describing the data set is: Yeh, I-Cheng, Modeling slump flow of concrete using second-order regressions and artificial neural networks, Cement and Concrete Composites, Vol.29, No. 6, 474-480, 2007.
I have used the GLMNET package for MATLAB for this project (https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/glmnet_matlab/).
