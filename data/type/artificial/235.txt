DroidSkynet consists of four major components: basic information analysis , source code extractor, protection method analysis, and weaknesses analysis. The basic information analysis component accepts an APK file of an app, parses the AndroidMainfest.xml inside the APK file, and extracts the basic information. Those information concluding package name, version code and version name. This part let us know what app and what version we are testing on. Source code extractor extracts source code from the APK file, and whether this process has been successfully executed provides the basis for protection method analysis. Based on the outcome of last process, the protection method analysis component identifies whether the APK file is protected by structure-protection. At the same time, protection method analysis component determines whether the APK file is protected by logic-protection by checking if the source code is obfuscated. Finally, weaknesses analysis component combining with the analyzing results above, the conclusion about whether the application is suffered this application is given. The key to weaknesses analysis is to find a compromisable app is running properly. We define the concept running properly is that its operating environment unchanged or some privacy related functionality has not changed. There is a predefined sensitive keyword dataset, one be considered to disclosure sensitive information or to be used to launch attacks. Protection method analysis and weaknesses analysis are the core modules of our tools. We name the tool DroidSkynet. The word Skynet come from the famous movie Terminator, the artificial intelligence named Skynet started coming back from the future by using a time machine, to kill the young leader of the resistance and halt humanity. Although our DroidSkynet have no ability to go back in time, it can find weaknesses exits in the earlier version and use it to launch attacks for newly updated versions. Further more, This tool can also discerns between applications with protection and applications without protection, distinguishes what of type protection mechanism application used ,and gives us a good idea of trends about application protection. More powerful modules will be added in the future.
