Artificial Neural Network
This project is to make an Artificial Neural Network.
Introduction
Here, we make an Artificial Neural Network to predict Handwritten digits by using the Large Dataset Created by MNIST. We create our model using Keras Deep Learning libraries which makes making of a neural network very much easier.
