Data Set Information:
This dataset is taken from a research explained here.   The goal of the research is to help the auditors by building a classification model that can predict the fraudulent firm on the basis the present and historical risk factors. The information about the sectors and the counts of firms are listed respectively as Irrigation (114), Public Health (77), Buildings and Roads (82), Forest (70), Corporate (47), Animal Husbandry (95), Communication (1), Electrical (4), Land (5), Science and Technology (3), Tourism (1), Fisheries (41), Industries (37), Agriculture (200).  There are two csv files to present data. Please merge these two datasets into one dataframe. All the steps should be done in Python. Please don't make any changes in csv files. Consider Audit_Risk as target columns for regression tasks, and Risk as the target column for classification tasks.
Attribute Information: Many risk factors are examined from various areas like past records of audit office, audit-paras, environmental conditions reports, firm reputation summary, on-going issues report, profit-value records, loss-value records, follow-up reports etc. After in-depth interview with the auditors, important risk factors are evaluated and their probability of existence is calculated from the present and past records.
