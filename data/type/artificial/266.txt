 semi supervised recursive deep auto encoders for sentiment prediction recently deep learning has enjoyed remarkable success in natural processing language establishing new state of the art performance in language modeling machine translation document classification and sentiment information retrieval this breakthrough in artificial intelligence is associated with the availability of massive amount datasets and the high computing power in this study we address the problem of sentiment prediction with zero prior knowledge using state of the art deep learning techniques autoencoders and denoising autoen coders we first survey the latest deep learning models for learning semantic representation then we develop theoretical and experimental study of these techniques that cover sentiment analysis and semantic representation keywords manifold learning computational semantic learning representation dimensionality reduction autoencoders cross entropy semi supervised learning link to the class https perso limsi fr xtannier teaching aic_rei index php
