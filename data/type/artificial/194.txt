Minimal-Neural-Classifier
An artificial neural network written from scratch to identify the correct class [0..9] of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. I tried to keep it as minimal as possible (one file, 300 lines of C# code) to provide a prove of concept if you are trying to understand how neural networks can be used for classification purposes.
