Handwritten_Digit_Recognition_Using_Keras
An ANN (Artificial Neural Network) for predicting the handwritten digit. Created with the help of Keras.
Dataset used
As I am using Keras to build a model with less time spent in data preprocessing, I have used keras dataset MNIST.
The MNIST dataset can be downloaded separately from here: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
Prediction
As I have trained using the Keras dataset (MNIST), I had tested it with test samples but I have googled a handwritten image and feed it to the model to predict.
Here below is the image used to predict and the link to the image is: https://goo.gl/gqzFvm



Handwritten image of digit 5
The model gives an accuracy of 0.9021 &
The Loss is 0.3240.
