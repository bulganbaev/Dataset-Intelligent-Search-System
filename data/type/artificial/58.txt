Image-Transform
A short program to artificially increase dataset size.
This code is not built for large datasets, but rather for anyone who wants to begin exploring Deep Learning and datasets in general. It is written in Python and uses modules cv2, numpy, random, and glob.
The program reads in all images in a folder, then randomly transform it 1 - 5 different ways: Rotate, Shift, Flip, Brightness, and Contrast. I wrote this program to be easily changed to increase the probability of the image to be transformed as well as the transformations themselves.
Currently built for Imagenet datasets but can easily be altered. All transformed images should be quickly re-checked with a human eye to make sure the object is still recognizable.
Prerequisites

OpenCV (https://opencv.org/)
Folder with dataset, preferably Imagenet (www.image-net.org/)



Installing


Fork and download this repository


Move my imageTransform.py into the folder with your dataset in it


Check to see what your dataset image extention is and change the code accordingly. Currently it is (.JPEG)


for filename in glob.glob('*.JPEG'):

#Near the bottom
newFile = x[0] + "_NEW-" + str(i) + ".JPEG"

newFile = x[0] + "_NEW-" + str(i) + ".JPEG"


Alter code so you get the desired transformations


Running


Open Terminal


Move to your folder dataset


Run file


python3 imageTransform.py



Altering the transformations
Probability  of the Transformation
The probability of the Transformation means how likely the Transformation will occur for each image
The transformations are currently set to occurr 50% probability for each image
#Gives a 1/2 chance
if random.sample(set([0, 1]), 1) == [0]:

If you would like to decrease the probability, you can add more numbers other than 1 to the array:
#Gives a 1/3 chance
if random.sample(set([0, 1, 2]), 1) == [0]:

If you would like to increase the probability,you can add more numbers other than 1 to the array and change the expression to not:
#Gives a 2/3 chance
if random.sample(set([0, 1, 2,]), 1) != [0]:


Rotation Selection
Rotation Transformation means rotating the image about the center a set number of degrees
The rotation transformations are set to rotate the image by 0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees
rotateChoice = [0,90,180,270]

You can edit the array to add more or less rotational choices or edit them:
#Adds 45 degree options
rotateChoice = [0,45,90,135,180,225,270,315]


Shift Selection
Shift Transformation means shifting the image horizontally or vertically a set number of pixels
NOTE: Shifting the image adds black area to the part of the image that was shifted. Do not add much to the shift choices because that will shift the object out of the frame.
The shift transformations are set to shift the image horizontally and vertically by -15, -5, 0, 5, or 15 pixels
horizontalChoice = [-15,-5,0,5,15]
verticleChoice = [-15,-5,0,5,15]

You can edit the array to add more or less shift choices or edit them:
#Limits shift to 10 pixels
horizontalChoice = [-10,0,10]
verticleChoice = [-10,0,10]


Flip Selection
Flip Transformation means mirroring the image horizontally or vertically or both about the center line
The flip transformations are randomly decided between horizontally or vertically or both
flipChoice = [1,2,3]

You can edit the array to lessen the flip choices or to increase the probability a specific choice will happen:
#50% of the time, Flip will be horizontal
flipChoice = ["hor","hor","ver","both"]


Brightness and Contrast Selection
Brightness and Contrast Transformation means either decreasing or increasing the brightness and contrast of the entire image
Contrast value is a multiplier
Brightness is an additive
NOTE: Adjusting the image brightness and contrast too much will result in completely white or completely black photos as well as a poor dataset
Brightness and Contrast choices are set as such:
contrastChoice = [.2, .5, .7, 1, 1.3, 1.5, 1.7, 2]
brightnessChoice = [-50, -40, -30, -20, -10, 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

You can edit the array to add more or less brightness and contrast choices or edit them:
#Lessoned the number of choices
contrastChoice = [.5, .7, 1, 1.3, 1.5]
brightnessChoice = [-20, -10, 0, 10, 20]
