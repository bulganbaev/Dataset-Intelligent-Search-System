Backpropogation Neural Network for iris dataset
This artificial neural network program only suitable for iris-datasets.
The dataset used in this program has been normalized.
#Input
There are 4 inputs/independant variables which are :

sepal-length
sepal-width
petal-length
petal-width

#Output
There are 3 outputs that will be classify which are :

Iris-Setosa
Iris-Versicolour
Iris-Verginica

##Sample output

#How to use this program?
Main.java
Main function where need to state your :

learning rate
number of epoch
number of classes - you can ignore this since this is static, unless you change the dataset
