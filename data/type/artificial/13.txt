The simple add sequence dataset

Randomly generate pieces of data for sas GE/LT classification task. Each piece of data has an input string and an output label.

The input string has 4 integer numbers, seperated by blanks. There are two candidate output labels -- "GE" and "LT".

Denote the 4 integer as a, b, c, ans (in sequential order). If a+b-c >= ans, the output label should be "GE"; otherwise, the output label should be "LT".

eg. Input: "65 235 328 905"; output: "LT".
    Input: "744 25 3 376"; output: 'GE'.

Generator and dataset classes are included in the package.
