Artificial-Neural-Networks-for-Handwritten-Digits-Recognition
Implementation, training and test of a  Neural Network for the Handwritten Digits Recognition problem with different settings of hyperparameters. The dataset used here is The MNIST dataset which was constructed from scanned documents available from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Images of digits were taken from a variety of scanned documents, normalized in size and centered.
