TensorFlow_MNIST_ANN
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) assignment for Machine Learning course using TensorFlow library in Python on the MNIST dataset
The purpose of this study was to test alternative network structures, and activation functions, for fitting a Neural Network (NN) to the MNIST data. Two- layer and five-layer neural networks were compared, with different numbers of nodes and node configurations, as well as utilizing different activation functions. The dataset considered was the MNIST, which consists of a set of 70,000 handwritten digits by high school students and employees of the US Census Bureau. The models were compared using the F1-score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. They were also evaluated based on the time it took to run the models.
