COCO-Africa: A Curation Tool and Dataset of Common Objects in the Context of Africa

Project is still in development **


The Coco Africa project is geared towards creating an easy to use data collection tool to support the
  curation of interesting datasets (current focus on under-represented objects and contexts in Africa).
The Data Collection Tool
This repo mainly contains code for the data collection interface(s) being used to support the curation of the COCO-Africa dataset. The current web interface is built with the following main features.

Perform image searches under a given keyword, selectively save a subset of all results. Searching using the flickr interface is currently supported.
Support annotation of saved images.

The Datasets

COCO Africa Masks (To be released soon): A dataset of African masks to foster experiments in the intersection of African Art and AI.
Early results training an unconditional GAN (DCGAN) on a curated dataset of African masks (10k) are shown below.


Trained Models
As the project progresses, trained models will be made available  for tasks trained on aspects of the COCO-Africa dataset.
Setup
Add your flickr and google client app credentials in the utils/credentials_default.py file and then rename it to credentials.py
cd utils
cp credentials_default.py credentials.py   #rename file
Running
python webserver.py
