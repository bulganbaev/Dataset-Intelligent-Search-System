Validation and Verification of Database Tables. Profile any SAS dataset. Cardinality, outliers, top n frequencies, bottom n frequencies, one to many, many to many, associations between numerical and character variables and duplicates on key
/*
%let pgm=oto_voodoo;

use this to get locations of macros for easy editiong;
once program is solid you may want to move macros to autocall library;
data null;
infile "c:\utl\oto_voodoo.sas" lrecl=300 recfm=v;
input;
if index(lowcase(infile),'%macro')>0 then do;
macro=scan(left(infile ),1,'(');
put @5 n @15 macro $32.;
end;
run;quit;

What this macro does
see the tail of this program for same usage
You should be able to run this as is.
The macro invocation is at the end of this file

Dataset level summary -- ie number of obs, variable types, static data
Cardinality page  (primary keys, codes/decodes  number of unique
values for every variable - EG fails here)
Complete frequency for all variables numeric and character with less
than 200 levels
For variables with over 200 levels top 100 most frequent and bottom
100 least frequent
Least frequent are the more interesting cases.
Proc means on all numeric variables
Proc univariate on all numeric variables
Special datetime  analysis
Histograms on all variables with less than 200 levels
Proc contents
Frequency of all numeric variables Missing, negative, zero and positive
Duplicates on single or compound key. Output printed vertically for
easy comparison
Cross tabs of every variable with every other variable top 16 levels
(if selectd)
You can also select one variable to cross tab with all other variables
max top 16 levels
Maximum and minimum lengths to hold all numeric and character variables
exactly (optimize)
Correlation of all pairs of numeric variables sorted by largest
correlation to lowest.
Nice display of max and mins for numeric and character in one table
List of identical columns ie date and date1 have equal values on all
observations
19   One to Many, Many to One, One to Many and Many to Many
20   Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Statistics (Cramer relationship amoung catagorical variables)
21   Finds missing patterns
22   Printout of first 20, middle 20 and last 20 observations.
23   Missing Pattern amalysis
24   Missing populated in a single table
