Artificial-Neural-Network
Applied different Artificial Neural Network ( ANN ) architectures or different Multi-Layered Perceptron ( MLP ) architectures on MNIST dataset which is inbuilt in Keras library . MNIST dataset contains images of all hand - written digits from 0 to 9 . our task is to classify them all by using various architectures of artificial neural networks.
Objective:
Build various MLP architectures for MNIST dataset.
Data Source: You can load data from this library(from keras.datasets import mnist)
