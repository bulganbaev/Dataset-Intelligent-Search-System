Perceptron
Prerequisites
Python3.5 64 bit
Installing
Pip
If you do not have pip, you can install it by running
python3.5 get-pip.py

Python requirements
Once pip is installed you can download the requirements for this project with
pip3.5 install -r requirements.txt

Running
The functions to implement for the exercises are located in perceptron_src/Perceptron_td.py. Once you are satisfied with your implementation, you can run the program using:
python3.5 main.py

Instructions
Introduction
In 2012 Krizhevsky et al. achieved groundbreaking results in the field of image classification using a Convolutional Neural Network. The paper imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks explains how they achieved these results.
Goal
The goal here is to reimplement a version of this network that will be trained and tested on the CIFAR-10 image classification dataset.

1st, using the dataset documentation, you will load the data from the cifar-10-batches-py directory and preprocess it so that it can be used with the Keras framework
2nd, using the layers file documentation you will reimplement the network described by the layers-18pct.cfg and layer-params-18pct.cfg files
3rd following the method described in the paper, you will perform data augmentation of the CIFAR-10 dataset to improve your results.
Bonus, Try ro improve the model to achieve the best possible results on the test batch
