DDI-100 dataset
In order to facilitate a new document recognition research, we introduce a Distorted Document Images dataset (DDI-100).
To create the dataset we collected 7709 unique document pages, and extended it by applying different types of distortions and geometric transformations.
In total, DDI-100 contains 115635 document images together with text masks, stamp masks, text and character locations in terms of bounding boxes.
