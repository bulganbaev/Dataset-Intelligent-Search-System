fastMRI
Accelerating Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) by acquiring fewer measurements has the
potential to reduce medical costs, minimize stress to patients and make MR imaging
possible in applications where it is currently prohibitively slow or expensive.
fastMRI is collaborative research project from Facebook AI Research (FAIR)
and NYU Langone Health to investigate the use of AI to make MRI scans faster.
NYU Langone Health has released fully anonymized Knee MRI datasets that can
be downloaded from the fastMRI dataset page.
This repository contains convenient PyTorch data loaders, subsampling functions, evaluation
metrics, and reference implementations of simple baseline methods.

Directory Structure & Usage

common: Contains several utility functions and classes that can be used to
create subsampling masks, evaluate results and create submission files.
data: Contains PyTorch data loaders for loading the fastMRI data and PyTorch
data transforms useful for working with MRI data. See data/README.md for more
information about using the data loaders.
models: Contains the baseline models.

Testing
Run pytest.
Submitting to Leaderboard
Run your model on the provided test data and create a zip file containing your
predictions. Upload this to any publicly accessible cloud storage (e.g. Amazon
S3, Dropbox etc) and then create a JSON file with your information.
The common/utils.py file has some convenience functions to help with this:

save_reconstructions function saves the data in the correct
format.
create_submission_file creates a JSON file for submission.

Submit the JSON file on the
