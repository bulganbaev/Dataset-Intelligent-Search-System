Quick start imagenet in pytorch
ImageNet has become a staple dataset in computer vision, but is still pretty difficult to download/install. These are some simple instructions to get up and running in pytorch.
step 1: download/preprocessing

begin by following the instructions for downloading the ImageNet dataset here
the dataset contains ~1.2 million training images and 50,000 validation images
note that the dataset is quite large: the .tar files are 138G for train and 6.3G for val

once extracted the train data is 177G and the val data is 8.3G


the folder hierarchy looks liks this (val looks similar, there are 1000 folders, one for each class):

train/
	n04550184/
		n04550184_9946.JPEG
        n04550184_9945.JPEG  
        ...
	n04550180/
	...
	n04550180/
step 2: get the names for each class

to get the names for each of the classes, look at the class_names_imagenet.py file, which contains a dictionary containing the class labels

step 3: set up a dataloader

in pytorch, the dataloader should be set up using an ImageFolder
there is an example here
