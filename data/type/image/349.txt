optical-illusion-dataset
JSON files with image links and metadata for optical illusions. Stay tuned as it grows and the images are released in gzip format from University host
Files:


mo-scraper.py:  final version of web scraping script for moillusions


moillusions_data.json:  json of image URLs and metadata for moillusions


mo-downloader.py: downloades images linked in JSON above into data/


viper-scraper.py: viperlib scraper script


viperlib_data.json: viperlib image URLs and metadata


viper-downloader.py: downloades images linked in JSON above into data/


Sources:
6436 image links and metadata from https://www.moillusions.com/
1454 image links and metadata from http://viperlib.york.ac.uk/
Download JPEGs:
The full image download can be found here (6725 images) :

A greatly reduced dataset of only images that have eye-bending patterns is here (569 images, hand picked):

My dataset build procese:
If you want to replicate it, for more latest images, or if some weird bug appears and documentation becomes important:

run a scraper to make the JSON file of all images
run a downloader to download images to data/
make sure rename, mogrify, and file are installed on your system
run bash cleanconvert.sh to convert everything to jpg, and verify all images using file
Investigate lines printed out, but I doubt you'll get anything unless you're unlucky
look in data/ if it has lots of #####.jpg and nothing else
rename data/ to something like viper-data/ etc

Next steps

come up with a scheme to combine website provided categories (some effort towards this in combiner.py)
train a GAN on the filtered images
learn a latent space for the images and do dimensionality reduction of some sort on it
