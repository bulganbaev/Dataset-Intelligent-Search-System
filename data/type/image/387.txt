News
TOTAL-TEXT is a word-level based English curve text dataset. If you are interested in text-line based dataset with both English and Chinese instances, we highly recommend you to refer SCUT-CTW1500. In addition, a recent ICDAR2019 Robust Reading Challenge on Arbitrary-Shaped Text (ArT), which is extended from Total-Text and SCUT-CTW1500, is held for stimulating more innovative ideas on the arbitrary-shaped text reading task. We welcome your participation, and the winner will walk away with substantial awards.
Important Annoucement
Total-Text and SCUT-CTW1500 are now part of the training set of the largest curved text dataset - ArT (Arbitrary-Shaped Text dataset). In order to retain the validity of future benchmarking on both mentioned datasets, we will soon provide a list of ID for users to remove the images of Total-Text and SCUT-CTW1500 from the ArT dataset shall one intend to leverage the extra training data from the ArT dataset. We count on the trust of the research community to perform such removal operation to attain the fairness of the benchmarking.
Table Ranking

The results from recent papers on the Total-Text dataset are listed below where P=Precision, R=Recall & F=F-score.
If your result is missing or incorrect, please do not hesisate to contact us.

Note:
1For the results of TextField and CTD, the improved versions of their original paper were used, and this explains why the performance is better.
2For Mask-TextSpotter, the relatively poor performance reported in their paper was due to a bug in the input reading module (which was fixed recently). The authors were informed about this issue.

Description
In order to facilitate a new text detection research, we introduce Total-Text dataset (ICDAR-17 paper) (presentation slides), which is more comprehensive than the existing text datasets. The Total-Text consists of 1555 images with more than 3 different text orientations: Horizontal, Multi-Oriented, and Curved, one of a kind.
