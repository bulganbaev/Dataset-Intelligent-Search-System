Finding dataset for training our deep learning models is always a challenge. Most of the time we need to manually download the images and annotate which is a time consuming task.
This repo provides scripts which can automate the image download part.
How to use?

Open google images and type the keyword related to the image search eg. "Hotdog".
Scroll till the images appearing are relevant to your search.
Go to View -> Developer -> Javascript console. A Javascript console will get open.
Click on Console.
Enter the content of js_console.js line by line into console. After the last command, a file named "urls.txt" will get created in your Download directory.
Execute the download_images.py script with this command:

python download_images.py --urls "path to url.txt" --output "path to image download folder"
