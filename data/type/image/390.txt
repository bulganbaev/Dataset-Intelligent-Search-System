Semantics Segmentation of Urban Environments
This is my undergraduate dissertation project. The goal of this thesis is to examine and compare the results from two variations of CNN Encode-Decode arhitectures using Self-Normalization technique along with CRF-RNN post processing unit. Due to visualize the results of the model properly a Visualizer based on CityscapesScripts has been implemented to visualize the results.

Installation
Run make inside lib/crfasrnn_keras/src/cpp to build highdimfilter module.
Create the npy data files for the data generator using denseExtraction.py.
Check the examples below to train your model.
Examples
Training

Resume  Training
python train.py -trp trainpath -vdp validationpath -tsp testpath -bs 4 -w weightspath -m modelpath -e 20
Acknowledgments

I want to thank Sadeep Jayasumana for his excellent work with CRF-RNN post-processing unit implementation in keras.
