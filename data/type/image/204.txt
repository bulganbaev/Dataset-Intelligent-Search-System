facial-image-dataset-for-deep-learning
This repo contains my self-built dataset for deep learning-facial image rating track. Feel free to use the code or dataset if you want to train your own rater machine.
The final dataset contains 682 labeled(1-10) facial images and you can do data augmentation by yourself.
Steps from sctrach:
1.Crawled thousands of images from facebook and only keep the high quality white woman facial images.
2.run py document as follows:
run find_faces_in_picture.py
run rename.py
run resize_image.py

run CNN.py

zip files specified:
The original dataset web_image
The datasets with logical names full_data_rename.zip
The final dataset after every image standardized to 224x224x3 full_data_standardize.zip
p.s. the dataset originally published in kaggle
