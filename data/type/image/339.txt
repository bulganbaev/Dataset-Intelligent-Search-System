CRF-Digit-Image-Denoising
Denoising of noisy MNIST dataset images using Conditional Random Fields
Noisy images of a particular digit are denoised using a trained CRF model. The CRF model is implemented using the PyStruct library
The problem statement requires the denoising of images of a particular digit using CRF's.
Models

CRFBasic.py Basic model with unary potentials defined by node pixel value.
