Image-Classifier
Create a image classifier based on the given dataset
Work flow

image preprocess

The code preprocess read the pictures.csv file, automatically creates folders named by the classes, read through the images, resize the images and put the images into correct folder.
When it is done, put the data into classifier/data folder for further training.

training process

Run the following command for training
./code/train.sh path/to/classifier

The training uses docker image tensorflow/tensorflow:0.9.0-devel. First, the bottlenecks of each image is created, then the bottlenecks are used to train the last layer of the inception model. During the training steps, each step calculate 3 values: training_accuracy, cross_entropy and validation_accurary.

testing process

Run the following command for testing
./code/guessDir.sh path/to/classifier path/to/testing_data path/to/tesing_data_after_classification

After testing, run the command to get the testing accuracy
python code/accuracy.py
