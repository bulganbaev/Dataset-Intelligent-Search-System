LFWgender
Getting the known gender based on name of each image in the Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset.
This is a python script that calls the genderize.io API with the first name of the person in the image. If the confidence is more than 90% the file gets copied to the corresponding gender folder: male/female.
The image is ignored if the name is not found in the genderize.io database.
Usage

Change the rootdir variable to the directory of the Labeled
Faces in the Wild dataset.
Change the maleFolder and femaleFolder variables to the directory where the images should be copied based on their gender

This script was developed and used together with Labeled Faces in the Wild for the research paper found here.
