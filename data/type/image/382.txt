The Images of Groups Dataset
Here is the script that allows you to scan the face images from the Group Images Dataset using the metadata stored in "PersonData.txt" for each group separately.
The faces are captured using Haar Classifier and then the coordinates are match with provided metadata.
Some faces may not be detected, and some non-faces may be detected, which will be verified using metadata information and stored in a directory named "outDir/"
The images are split among 11 folders, based on the keyword search used to download the images from Flickr. The images are either
Wedding images, Family images, or Group images. The folders of images are as follows:
Wed2a
Wed3a
Wed5a
Fam2a
Fam4a
Fam5a
Fam8a
Group2a
