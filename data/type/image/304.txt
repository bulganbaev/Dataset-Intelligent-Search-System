Most of the code in this repository is taken from here
This repository has four independent parts:
1- The code used for Task I: Detecting Images That Contain Animals (phase1 folder)
2- The code used for Task II,III, and IV: identifying, counting, and describing animals in images (phase 2 folder)
3- The code used for Task II only, (all the transfer learning experiments for Task II used this part of the repo) (phase2_recognition_only folder)
4- resize.py is used for resizing the input images for all the other parts
