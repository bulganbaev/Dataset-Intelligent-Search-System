American Sign Language Image Classifier


We win 2018 Qualcomm AI Hackathon with this convolutional neural net model.


Achieved 100% prediction accuracy on the test set. It also achieves around 78% accuracy on CIFAR-10 dataset. It is most likely that this architecture also works on other image datasets as well.


American sign language image dataset is available on kaggle.


CNN Architecture


With this architecture above alone and 10 epochs we got reached 97.6% on the test dataset.
After data augmentation we reached 100% within 10 epochs.
