Machine learning may appear magic to many who are new to this field and do not understand the science behind how it all works. Even for programmers who come from traditional web and app development background, it is sometimes quite hard to understand how can a program recognise an image or generate a stock price prediction?
Through this project I have tried to demonstrate a basic bare bones structure of how a simple Image classifier works. I will start with basic k Nearest Neighbour matching and then upgrade the project to use advanced Neural Network based algorithms.
The structure of the project is motivated by Stanford CS231N course, however most of the code is handwritten from scratch using Python. I have also commented the code so that it is easier for you to understand how the plumbing works.
The code is only for educational purposes and comes as "AS IS" with no warranty.
Let me know any comments or feedback
