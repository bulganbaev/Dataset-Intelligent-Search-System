Generic-image-classfication
Generic image classification for custom dataset with various models, implemented by Keras
Multi-gpu is supported.
Requirments

Python 3.5 or 3.6
Tensorflow >= 1.8.0
Keras >= 2.2.0

Preprocess
No need to change the resolution of the images
Automatic data augmenatation is implemented in this library
Split custom dataset into following structure

train

class1
class2


val

class1
class2


test

class1
class2



Available Models
