ImageNet32-tensorflow
Implementation of the Wide Residual Networks used to classify the downscaled ImageNet dataset. This model in TensorFlow achieves the same Top-1 and Top-5 errors as reported in the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08819 and runs 2-3 times faster than the Theano version. Furthermore, the bottleneck residual building block is also implemented which improves the accuracy to some extent compared to the baseline residual block.
