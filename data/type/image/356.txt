cnn-bcdr
Source code for Representation learning for mammography mass lesion classification with convolutional neural networks (pdf).
Dependencies
This code is written in python. To use it you will need:

Python 2.7
Pylearn2 (tested on pylearn2@30437ee)
Scipy
[Shapely] (https://github.com/Toblerity/Shapely)

Usage
Data
With this paper we released the Breast Cancer Digital Repository F03 (BCDR-F03) dataset. You can get a copy from http://bcdr.inegi.up.pt/ (mirror at: https://bcdr.ceta-ciemat.es). Uncompress it under the data folder.
Preprocessing


Create hdf5 dataset:
python make_dataset.py config.yaml



Build preprocessed version (GCN + LCN):
python preprocessing.py config.yaml



Training
The hyperparameters to train the network are in the config.yaml file. Train the model:
python train_cnn.py config.yaml

Evaluation
Evaluate trained model:
python eval.py config.yaml
