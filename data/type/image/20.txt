Google open image download
A py2/py3 script for downloading and rescaling the open image
dataset in parallel. Here it is maxing out a 200mbit pipe
over 5 days.

setup
To install dependencies run
pip install -r requirements

Follow the instructions on the open image data repo to
get the list of image urls.
usage
The two requirement arguments are input and output. Input is the csv file of urls from the open
image data set. Output is a directory where the scaled images will be saved.
By default, the images will be scaled so that the smallest dimension is equal to 256 (controlled by
the min-dim arg). The saved images are placed in sub-directories for efficiency (the number of
which is controlled by the sub-dirs arg). The name of the saved image corresponds to Google's
ImageID which can be used to look up labels in the open image dataset.
Use --help to see the other optional args.
notes
I'm not using asyncio because the processes also scale the image so we wouldn't see much speed up
