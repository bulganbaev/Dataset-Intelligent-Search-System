Image-Recognition-Using-CNN
Distinguish between animals or humans, with proper datasets.
1.Dataset
2.Dataset included:
Images for:

Cats
Dogs

Test Sets:
  Cats: 1000
  Dogs: 1000

Train Sets:
  Cats: 4000
  Dogs: 4000

Libraries used:

Keras
scikit-learn
Tensorflow

Program run on:

Spyder
Python 3.5

Steps Applied :

Convolution
Pooling
First Two Steps repeated to increase accuracy
Flattening
Full Connection Establishment
Fitting Image to CNN

NOTE: The program was run on windows 10, 64 bit. The epoch rate was pretty slow, to fix the issue, in fit_generator, 'steps_per_epoch' and 'validation_steps' were divied by its batch_size. It decreased the overall execution time.
Overall accuracy of the Test set to Training set :
0.8870:0.8115
Accuracy may differ on different systems.
