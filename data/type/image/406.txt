Tensorflow Dog Breed Classifier
For all those dog lovers like me out there, here is a Tensorflow image classifier that can preict the breed of a dog from its photo. This model is trained to detect 5 different breeds of dog.

Rottweiler
Bulldog
Pug
German Shepherds
Labrador

Intrestingly enough, the model was able to classify the dog breed even from the picture of its toy. Feel free to fork and play around with the classifier.
How to run the basic model
For an image located at <path-to-image-file>, run :
python classifier.py --image_path <path-to-image-file>
