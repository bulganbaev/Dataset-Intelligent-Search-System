Food-101 Dataset Using Transfer Learning
Inspired by HBO’s Silicon Valley “Not Hotdog” App, I set out to classify not only hotdogs but 101 categories of different foods. The other goal was to use data augmentation and transfer learning and data augmentation to achieve fast(er) training time and accuracy.
Prerequisites

Food-101 dataset
Nvidia GPU or cloud GPU instances for training
Tensoflow
Keras
Numpy
