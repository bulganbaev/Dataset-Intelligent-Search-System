CIFAR-10 Image Classification
About
This is a solution to the CIFAR10-dataset, consisting of 50,000 classified
32x32 pixel images of 10 classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog,
frog, horse, ship and truck.
The solution is a convolutional neural network that achieves 85% accuracy on
the dataset.
Motivation
Image classification using deep learning has become very popular, and seems to
be one of the best methods. Images with more features (and higher resolution)
require more sophisticated networks that are able to consider the translation
invariance of features, and other important aspects of image classification.
This project was meant to give an insight and understanding of how
convolutional neural networks work, different methods for improving a model
(batch normalization, data augmentation etc.) and the evaluation of complex
models.
Solution
The solution can be found in a documented Jupyter Notebook
in docs/cifar-project.ipynb.
A full evaluation of the models used are found in the notebook, as well as a
comparison with a FCNN-model on the same dataset, and an application of
transfer-learning.
