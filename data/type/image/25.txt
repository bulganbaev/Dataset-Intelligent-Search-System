Find_Similar_Images
In this project, I have used OpenCV library in Python to find the similar images in a dataset.
The methods that have been used are Color Histograms and Feature Matching to predict whether given two images are similar or not.
The Similarity of Images have been classified into 4 categories:

Almost Same
Very Similar
Somewhat Similar
No Match

For the use of this project, make sure OpenCV2 is installed with SIFT/SURF features along with other libraries like matplotlib, scipy, numpy etc.
Clone the repository by using


git clone https://github.com/mansigoel/Find_Similar_Images.git
cd Find_Similar_Images


Create a folder 'Dataset' and add all the images there


mkdir Dataset


run final.py


python final.py


When asked, enter the full path of image like 'Dataset/image.jpg' without quotes.
Script will run and the status of every image [Match or not] can be seen on terminal along with their correlation and feature match percentage.
