imagenetscraper

 

Command-line utility for downloading all thumbnail images from an ImageNet
synset, optionally rescaling to a different resolution.

Usage
Usage: imagenetscraper [OPTIONS] SYNSET_ID [OUTPUT_DIR]

Options:
  -c, --concurrency INTEGER  Number of concurrent downloads (default: 8).
  -s, --size WIDTH,HEIGHT    If specified, images will be rescaled to the
                             given size.
  -q, --quiet                Suppress progress output.
  -h, --help                 Show this message and exit.
  --version                  Show the version and exit.

If the URL of a synset page looks like:
http://image-net.org/synset?wnid=n00000000
                                 ^^^^^^^^^
                                 SYNSET_ID

SYNSET_ID is the n00000000 part. For example, for the "person,
individual, someone, somebody, mortal, soul" synset at
http://image-net.org/synset?wnid=n00007846, the corresponding synset id is
n00007846.
The default output directory (OUTPUT_DIR) is the current directory.

Examples
To download all thumbnail imagess from the synset mentioned above to the
directory "person_images", run:
imagenetscraper n00007846 person_images

To do the same, but with each thumbnail image rescaled to a width of 256 and a
height of 128, add --size 256,128:
imagenetscraper n00007846 person_images --size 256,128

To run in "quiet mode", suppressing progress output, add --quiet:
imagenetscraper n00007846 person_images --size 256,128 --quiet

By default, imagenetscraper will download 8 images at once. To change this, use
--concurrency:
imagenetscraper n00007846 person_images --size 256,128 --concurrency 4
