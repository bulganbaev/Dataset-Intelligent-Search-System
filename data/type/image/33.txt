ImageDatasetTools
A collection of tools for annotating object detection datasets for machine learning.
makeLabelFiles.sh
This script takes a directory of .jpg images as a commmand-line argument and makes a sub-directory called "LabelData" with a .txt file with the same name for each image in the original folder.
For use with euclid image annotation tool.
Example usage: ./makeLabelFiles.sh imagesDirectory/
euclid.py
This is just a copy of a useful image annotation tool that I found to be useful from here: https://github.com/prabindh/euclid
It supports the KITTI dataset format used by NVIDIA DIGITS for object detection. I recommend running the makeLabelFiles script first, as euclid will not make a .txt file for an image if no bounding boxes are drawn, which causes problems in DIGITS.
piCam.sh
This is a small utility I made using fswebcam to take images using a USB webcam at a given rate. Command-line argument is pause time in seconds between captures. It is really more of a time-lapse script for collecting training images for machine-learning object detection.
Example for 1 fps: ./piCam.sh 1
multiclassDetectnet
This is a version of NVIDIA's Detectnet caffe prototxt for object detection that I modified to support detection models on several classes at once. Instructions for use are included in the top of the file. Information about Detectnet can be found here: https://devblogs.nvidia.com/detectnet-deep-neural-network-object-detection-digits/
