ImageClassification
Compilation of ML algorithms to classify face datasets
These files will run the PCA, LDA, SVM, CNN implementations used for the report

pca_analysis
lda_analysis
svm_analysis
cnn_analysis

These files are needed to run all of the implementation python files

utils
prep_data (ensure directory in prep_data is modified correctly to extract CMU & Own images for classification)

To run:

ensure that each analysis file imports the utils & prep_data functions
change the parameters depending on the requirements of the experiment
a) Type of data to be extracted can be selected by the generate_data(1, 20, incl='y'), where 1st & 2nd arguments are the start & end of CMU data. incl indicates whether to include Own images in training set or not.
b) select model parameters i.e compute_pcs(xtrain, n) , n indicates the number of components to compute using PCA.
run the file and give the input of either 0,1,2 depending on the type of experiment to run
