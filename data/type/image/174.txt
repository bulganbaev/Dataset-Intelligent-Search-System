Image-Classification
In this project, I have classified images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects.
I have preprocessed the images, then trained a convolutional neural network on all the samples. The images need to be normalized and
the labels need to be one-hot encoded. I have build a convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers.
At the end, neural network make predictions on the sample images.
Updates
The project is not yet complete but it will still run.
The Inception Module is yet to be implemented.
Inception module:

Warning
Donot run this program on your CPU. Run it on a GPU or use cloud computing. I used AWS (Amazon web services).
I used EC2 instance. To be more specific i used g2.2xlarge GPU instance.
