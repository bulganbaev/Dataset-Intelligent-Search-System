Triplet Loss & Batch triplet loss & SVM
Here, I have some experiments in order to make more accurate classifier. Triplet Loss, Batch Triplet, SVM are used for experiments. softmax features + SVM was the best in my result as a record of 91% top1 accuracy.
Dataset
Kaggle's State Farm Distracted Driver Detection Dataset is used for evaluating the performance of Image Classification, you should modify sampledata.py to fit your dataset.
Setup
Rebuild your caffe directory:
cd $CAFFEROOT$
cp Makefile.configexample Makefile.config

Remember to uncomment the line to makesure your python layers could be found:
WITH_PYTHON_LAYER := 1

Then build caffe and pycaffe:
make all -j8 & make pycaffe

Usage


Modify sampledata.py, config.py and train.py to fit your dataset and working environment.


Pre-train your model with softmax loss.


Finetune triplet model based on your pre-trained model.


Learn to adjust parameters.


Result
softmax


triplet loss


batch triplet loss


softmax+svm
