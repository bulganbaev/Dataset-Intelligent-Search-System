Deep Learning for Inverse Problems
Overview
This project hosts the code and datasets I used for Deep Learning course at Boston University. It aims to post-process the images the low quality images produced as a result of solving inverse problems in imaging (particularly Computed Tomography) and produce high-quality images.
We use two different networks, modified U-Net [1], and VDSR [2], and compare their performance for a Computed Tomography problem.  Various parts of this implementation use codes from [3] and [4]. Please cite the relevant papers if you use a network in your work.
Data used for this work can be downloaded from the following Google drive link:

U-Net has been modified to produce single channel output of dimensions same as the dimensions of input image. Additionally, we also add Batch-Norm to each convolutional layers.
