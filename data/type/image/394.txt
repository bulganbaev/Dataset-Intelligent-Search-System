Overview
This repository was created for a coursework project for Neural Networks (CZ4042) at NTU, Singapore. Our tasks were to use deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for object recognition in images and to understand how stacked autoencoders work as content addressable memory.
Check out Project Description.pdf for more information and Report.pdf for details about our apporach and code, our results and some pretty graphs.
