Keras_Transform_Images
Script that transforms a folder of images. Each pictures is transformed into x number of transformations. Great for expanding a small dataset.
In the script, simply add the name of your folder where your images are stored and similarly add the name of the folder where you want to save the transformed images.
My directory, which runs with the code, looks like this:

The code takes a list of images and transforms each image into 5 (this can be changed) new transformations. This is helpful in machine learning if you need more images for growing your dataset larger.
