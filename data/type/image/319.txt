Deep Learning webapp
Simple image classification with 20 images

imageset has to be downloaded from VOC for classfication function to work

What it shows

Webapp allows for classification of an image
belonging to 1 of 20 classes given:

['aeroplane', 'bicycle', 'bird', 'boat',
'bottle', 'bus', 'car', 'cat', 'chair',
'cow', 'diningtable', 'dog', 'horse',
'motorbike', 'person', 'pottedplant',
'sheep', 'sofa', 'train',
'tvmonitor']

How to run it

For space reasons, VOCdevkit will not
be included, and has to be put under
static/ folder before running webapp
To build a new data.json to display
on the webapp, use BuildDB(saved_dict=<path_to_your_state_dict_here>)
to generate a new data.json
A trained_model.pt is required, which uses
a model of resnet18 to run.
