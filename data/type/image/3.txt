This project aims to use a deep optical CCD image of the extragalactic sky to determine the number counts of galaxies in the local universe (i.e., the number of galaxies brighter than a given magnitude as a function of magnitude). The computer programme will read in the CCD image, and then detect individual galaxies within this image and determine their brightness. This brightness can then be converted into an apparent magnitude and the number counts can then be derived.
