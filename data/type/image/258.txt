ImageSegmentation
This was a project for a course on Computer Vision where we implemented semantic segmentation on the COCO dataset.
We used the VGG19 model, pretrained on the ImageNet dataset as the backbone network for our model.
Deconvolutional layers were appended to VGG19 and the parameters of these layers were trained on the COCO dataset.
