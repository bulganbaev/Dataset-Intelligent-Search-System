Clean codes and optimal hyperparameters will be available soon.
Requirements
chainer>=5.0.0
opencv_python
numpy
scipy
Pillow
PyYAML

Run


Place sngan.npz and biggan.npz in this directory


Multiple GPU training is supported only for BigGAN.


for BigGAN (We used 4 GPUs for training)
mpirun python ./train.py --config_path configs/default.yml

for SNGAN
python ./train.py --config_path configs/default.yml
