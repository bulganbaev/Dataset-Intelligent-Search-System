Image classification performed on labeled dataset of Cats and Dogs
Data set used is - 12500 images of cats and dogs respectively
Supervised learning is used where the dataset is labeled with cats and dogs seperately.

Steps to perform the project -

Simply run cnn.py file first, this file will save the weights and model into a .h5 and .json file respectively
Next run the loaded_model.py file to make single predictions, add the image path in the 'test_image' variable in the code

This is a simple but effective classification using Convolutional Neural Networks, it is recommended to increase the number of epochs and input_shape if training is done on a GPU.
Building a CNN involves four major steps -
Step 1: Convolution
Step 2: Pooling - # Adding more convolutional layers
Step 3: Flattening
Step 4: Full connection
