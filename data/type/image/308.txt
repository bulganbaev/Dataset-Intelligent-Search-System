A Benchmark for Visual Identification of Defective Solar Cells in Electroluminescence Imagery
This repository provides a dataset of solar cell images extracted from
high-resolution electroluminescence images of photovoltaic modules.

The Dataset
The dataset contains 2,624 samples of 300x300 pixels 8-bit grayscale images of
functional and defective solar cells with varying degree of degradations
extracted from 44 different solar modules. The defects in the annotated images
are either of intrinsic or extrinsic type and are known to reduce the power
efficiency of solar modules.
All images are normalized with respect to size and perspective.
Additionally, any distortion induced by the camera lens used to capture the EL images was
eliminated prior to solar cell extraction.
Annotations
Every image is annotated with a defect probability (a floating point value
between 0 and 1) and the type of the solar module (either mono- or
polycrystalline) the solar cell image was originally extracted from.
The individual images are stored in the images directory and the corresponding
annotations in labels.csv.
Usage
In Python, use utils/elpv_reader in this repository to load the images and the
corresponding annotations as follows:
from elpv_reader import load_dataset
images, proba, types = load_dataset()
The code requires NumPy and Pillow to work correctly.
