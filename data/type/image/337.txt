Generating-Devanagari-Using-DRAW
PyTorch implementation of DRAW: A Recurrent Neural Network For Image Generation on the task of generating Devanagari Characters.



Training
Download the data and place it in the data/ directory. Run train.py to start training. To change the hyperparameters of the network, update the values in the param dictionary in train.py.
Loss Curve



Generating New Images
To generate new images run generate.py.
python3 evaluate.py -load_path /path/to/pth/checkpoint -num_output n
The checkpoint file for the model trained for 50 epochs is present in checkpoint/ directory.
