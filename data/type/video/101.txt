download_audioset
This repository makes it really easy to download Audioset, the open source library released by Google for speech object detection research.
AudioSet consists of an expanding ontology of 632 audio event classes and a collection of 2,084,320 human-labeled 10-second sound clips drawn from YouTube videos. The ontology is specified as a hierarchical graph of event categories, covering a wide range of human and animal sounds, musical instruments and genres, and common everyday environmental sounds.

Why make this repository?
When I first tried to download this dataset, I had some trouble getting the raw audio files. Google released most of the files as features that they extracted (via the AudioSet Embedding), but did not give access to raw .wav files. So, I made a script to make it easy to download this dataset locally on your computer or on a server.
The as_download.py script thus downloads and converts all the audio files in the AudioSet dataset from the YouTube to make it easy to do data science and modeling on this data. Specifically, it downloads the audio from the video files and clips these audio files at the designated time points and arranges all the classes into folders.
If you're looking for some models built from these folders, check out the audioset-models repository.
Note that if you are in China, these scripts may not work due to the Great Firewall and blocking YouTube as a website.
Downloading audio files
Here are some quick checks

Make sure you have roughly 35 GB of free space on your hard disk. You'll need roughly this much space before continuing.
This section assumes you are on a mac computer.

If you don't have homebrew installed, type this into the terminal:
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

Now, type this into your terminal:
cd ~ 
git clone git@github.com:jim-schwoebel/download_audioset.git
python3 setup.py
python3 as_download.py 

After you start the script, it will take roughly 1-2 days to fully download the dataset. This is because I implemented a 5 second sleep in between requests of downloading videos to not strain Google's server.
Note there are some cases where you cannot download the raw audio files, including:

When a video is removed
User account deleted
Not available in country
Need to sign in to view
Video no longer exists
