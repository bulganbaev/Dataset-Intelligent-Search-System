Video Semantic Labeler
This tool is used for making video semantic labeling ground truth data. It has been used for UAVid dataset.
This tool is built with Visual Studio2015 with qt5.6.2 and opencv3.3.0 for windows platform.
Features
You can use the tool to play the video at specific frame index or to label the video images.
