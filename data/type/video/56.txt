#####A few notes by the author
This dataset gives the whole state of Twitch.tv every 5 minutes, from Sept. 2011 to Jan. 2012:
it gives the list of all active channels and several informations about each of them.
As this dataset is complete and built in the very early stage of Twitch.tv,
it is of high interested for studying (video game) live streaming.
This dataset was originally created and studied in a scientific article:

Mehdi Kaytoue, Arlei Silva, Loïc Cerf, Wagner Meira Jr and Chedy Raïssi.
Watch me playing, I am a professional: a first study on video game live streaming"
In International Workshop on Mining Social Network Dynamics (MSND)
in conjunction with the conference WWW'2012. April 16, 2012. Lyon, France.

The goal of this page is to maintain an access to this dataset, and hopefully,
to invite others data scientists to share their datasets on Twitch.tv.
