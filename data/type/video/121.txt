cnn-lstm
CNN-LSTM for creating a latent representation of KTH action dataset videos
Decide your own:  No. of frames from each video
No. of videos from each class
Parameters for the model
Canny edge detection helps remove empty frames
All frames were resized to 128x128 dimension due to errors in model
npy_dataset.py creates separate numpy files for each action class and returns file of dimension (no.of vids, no.of frames, 128, 128, 1)
cnn_lstm.py takes each action class numpy file separately and makes predictions
I have not uploaded the numpy files, create your own
Feel free to download and modify
