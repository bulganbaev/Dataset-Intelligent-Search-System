game2vec - games embeddings
TensorFlow implementation of word2vec applied on https://www.kaggle.com/tamber/steam-video-games dataset, using both CBOW and Skip-gram.
Context for each game is extracted from the other games that the user owns. For example if a user has three games: Dota 2, CS: GO, and Rocket League, this (input -> label) pairs can be generated:

CBOW: ((Dota 2, CS: GO) -> Rocket League), ((Dota 2, Rocket League) -> CS: GO), ((CS: GO, Rocket League) -> Dota 2)
Skip-gram: (Rocket League -> (Dota 2, CS: GO)), (CS: GO -> (Dota 2, Rocket League)), (Dota 2 -> (CS: GO, Rocket League))

For more reference, please have a look at this papers:

Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality
word2vec Parameter Learning Explained
Explained: Deriving Mikolov et al.â€™s Negative-Sampling Word-Embedding Method

There are three training scripts:

train_cbow.py - training using CBOW, using both purchase and play actions into account as user context.
train_cbow_weighted.py - same as above, but, only play actions are taken into consideration, and the label is selected based on time played (more time played the game - higher the probability of being selected).
train_skipgram.py - training using Skip-gram, using both purchase and play actions into account as user context.

Each script outputs an image with the game embeddings visualised using t-SNE, and a .npy file containing embeddings, dictionary, and reverse dictionary:
{
    'embeddings': final_embeddings,
    'idx_to_game': idx_to_game,
    'game_to_idx': game_to_idx
}

There are three notebooks that load the embeddings + some examples:

player_cbow.py - loads embeddings_cbow.npy + example usage.
player_cbow_weighted.py - loads embeddings_cbow_weighted.npy + example usage.
player_skipgram.py - loads embeddings_skipgram.npy + example usage.

Visualisations are found in .png files.
Example training output:
There are 3600 unique games in the data set.
