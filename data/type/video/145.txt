Youtube Emotion Extractor
A tool that builds dataset of emotions for corresponding spoken sentences from Youtube videos using Affectiva API
Plan
Using Affectiva API, we can detect emotions present in each frame of a Youtube video.
Limitation and Workaround
Since Affectiva Javascript API is only available in browser, and takes image in form of canvas's imageData, this tool will be running in browser instead of in a standalone node.js application. Here's how it works:

A Youtube video is loaded into the page, playing under a video tag.
The playing video is then rendered to play on a canvas.
Each image frame is pulled from the canvas, and then mapped to words/sentences spoken from Youtube's annotation.
