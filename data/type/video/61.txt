Data Science Project #002 - Videogame Analysis
A very basic analysis of Video Game sales until about 2014, I think.
Artichopper, a friend from college, also made a similar analysis. We both are learning Data Science!
Anyway, in this project I made a analysis of number of games sold according to consoles and publishers using Pandas, and having some visualization with Seaborn.
