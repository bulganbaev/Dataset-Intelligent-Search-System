Action-Recognition
recognize actions from videos using machine learning classifier(s) and suitable features. You will use UCF sports action data set here http://crcv.ucf.edu/data/ucf_sports_actions.zip. UCF Sports dataset consists of a set of actions collected from various sports which are typically featured on broadcast television channels such as the BBC and ESPN. The video sequences were obtained from a wide range of stock footage websites including BBC Motion gallery and GettyImages. The dataset includes a total of 150 sequences with the resolution of 720 x 480. The collection represents a natural pool of actions featured in a wide range of scenes and viewpoints. By releasing the data set we hope to encourage further research into this class of action recognition in unconstrained environments. Since its introduction, the dataset has been used for numerous applications such as: action recognition, action localization, and saliency detection. The dataset includes the following 10 actions. The figure above shows the a sample frame of all ten actions, along with their bounding box annotations of the humans shown in yellow.
