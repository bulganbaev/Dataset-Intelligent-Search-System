BigDataAnalysis-1
Analyzing Video game sales Dataset analysis to mine meaningful insight.
Tools used: Python, R, MySQL
Goals:


Study trends in global video games sales across a period of 30+ years and identify key insights from comparing the major
platforms such as Nintendo, PlayStation and Xbox. Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the top three 7th generation consoles and determine the best performing platform.


Develop a predictive model to predict sales of games in Europe by performing Regression on sales in North America of the same games.


Approach:
Dataset from Kaggle.com- Rush Kirobi. 2017. Video Game Sales with Ratings.
Kaggle.com. (January 2017).

Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization performed using Panda, Numpy, Seaborn in Python to study and compare the performance of different console platforms.
By using Sales in North America for the list of 500 games, tested to predict the sales of the same games in Europe.
Used Degree of polynomial=3, to achieve a decently fitted model & to avoid over or under fitting.
Insights:


Performance of PS3 is most consistent across various regions and different genres.


XBox 360 sold the most number copies but it did not do well outside North America as compared to others.


Nintendo Wii sold the maximum number of titles worldwide for a single genre.


Developed a model to predict sales in Europe, achieving R2 score of 0.41 & Mean absolute error of 0.185.
