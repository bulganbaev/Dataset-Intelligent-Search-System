Inception V3 for TV Human Interactions dataset
ArXiv link
Code is used as part of our survey on human action & interaction recognition: Understanding human-human interactions: a survey [arXiv]
About
Applying Transfer Learning on Inception V3 model (weights trained on Imagenet) for the Oxford TV Human Interactions dataset. The network gets as inputs images extracted every 5 frames from videos.


Activations from the first convolutional layer that handles the input image


Grad-cam for the kiss class of an example from the HighFive dataset
Installation
Git is required to download and install the repo. You can open Terminal (for Linux and Mac) or cmd (for Windows) and follow these commands:
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install git
$ git clone https://github.com/alexandrosstergiou/Inception_v3_TV_Human_Interactions.git
Dependencies
The network was build with Keras while using the TensorFlow backend.  scikit-learn was used as a supplementary package for doing a train-validation split. Additionally, for the grad-cam visualisations the keras-vis toolkit was employed. Considering a correct configuration of Keras, to install the dependencies follow:
$ sudo pip install -U scikit-learn
$ sudo pip install keras-vis
