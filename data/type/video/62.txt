The INRS Audiovisual Quality Dataset
the details are given in publication [1,2,3]
File List:
MOS Folder: This Folder contains various MOS Score files. These files are:
FileNameWithMOS.csv: contains the name of audiovisual files and MOS scores computed.
BaseDataset.csv: Contains 5 independen parameters (video frame rate, quantization parameter, noise reduction, packet loss rate for audio and video streams) and MOS scores computed [1, 2].
WekaBaseDataset.arff: Same as BaseDataset in Weka format [1, 2].
ParametricDataset.csv: contains BaseDataset and other dependent parameters extracted from transmitted videos. Models using this dataset would be called parametric No-Reference models [1, 2].
WekaParametricDataset.arff: Same as ParametricDataset in Weka format [1, 2].
BitstreamDataset.csv: contains BaseDataset and other dependent parameters extracted from transmitetd videos as well as reduced amount of information from original videos. Models using this dataset would be called bitstream reduced-Reference models [3].
OutputVideoFiles Folder: This Folder contains saved output video files, RTCP stats collected during streaming for each file, consolidated statistics and video file header parameters, and randomized file list used in https://github.com/edipdemirbilek/SubjectiveAssesmentVideoPlayer.
SourceVideoFiles Folder: It includes source video files, and audio and video CAPS used in GStreaming.
SubjectDetails Folder: It contains ACR scores collected from all observers. These are non processed raw scores. No consolidation or rejection criteria is applied.
SubjectMerged Folder: Consolidated ACR scores with summary info. The scores here are after rejection criteria is applied. Refer to [1] for details.
CalculateCorrelation.py: Calculates the correlation of scrores of a given Subject with the overall MOS of all Subjects.
GenerateGraphs.py: Generates variosu graphs used in [1]
MergeSubjectDetails.py: Consolidates the ACR scores for a given Subject and also applies the rejection criteria specified in [1]
MergeSubjects.py: Consolidate all Subject scores and compines with detailed parameters and generates varios MOS files. Comments in the file itself.
PrepareBitstreamStats.py: From GStreamer RTCP stats file, it extracts only selected fields and stores in csv file.
SubjectsSummary.csv: includes, total number of accepted scores, average time to rate and correlation to the rest for each subject.
