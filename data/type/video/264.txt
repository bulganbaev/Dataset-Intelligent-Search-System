Video delivery dataset analysis in Python using Jupyter notebook
Dataset Information
This dataset data.csv is measuring the data downloaded through P2P (peer to peer) and through the CDN (Content Delivery Network) by the viewers.
Content
Each data point has the following dimension, represented with 6 variables:



Name
Description




#stream
ID of each stream


isp
Name of the Internet Service Provider


browser
Browser name


connected
Boolean value, true if the user is connected to the backend during his session


p2p
Data downloaded through P2P (peer to peer)


cdn
Data downloaded through CDN (Content Delivery Network)



Goal
The goal of this notebook is to explore the dataset and give recommendations as to where the service should be improved.
Technologies used

Python (version 3.7.0) - because the dataset is not too large to require some Big Data framework;
Jupyter notebook (version 5.7.2) - because of the readability and explanation of the steps;
Pandas library (version 0.23.4) - for data manipulation, analysis and plotting;
Seaborn library (version 0.9.0) - data visualization library based on matplotlib.

Approach

Understanding the dataset in terms of columns and their values;
Visualizing which values affect connectivity to the backend;
How much data is sent in which stream and over which ISP/browser;
Visualizing correlation between ISP, browser, connectivity and bandwidth;
Trying to see if there are points where the service could be improved.
