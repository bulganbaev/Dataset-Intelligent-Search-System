ISTOmnidirectional Dataset
The ISTOmnidirectional Dataset  is the result of a subjective assessment campaign, performed in IST - Technical University of Lisbon and IT - Instituto de Telecomunicações, that was conducted to evaluate the impact, on quality, of HEVC compression and/or spatial&temporal subsampling, when the omnidirectional videos are displayed in a head mounted device (HDM).
The subjective assessment results were used as ground-truth to evaluate conventional quality assessment metrics developed for 2D video, as well as some of the recently proposed metrics for omnidirectional video, namely, spherical peak-signal to noise ratio (S-PSNR), weighted to spherically uniform PSNR (WS-PSNR), and viewport PSNR (VP-PSNR); in the context of this study, the adaptation of two SSIM based metrics, to omnidirectional contents, were also proposed and evaluated. The ISTOmnidireccional dataset content includes:

Spatial subsampling (28 videos + MOS and DMOS scores; size: 5.7 Gbytes)
Temporal subsampling (30 videos +  MOS and DMOS scores; size: 9 Gbytes)
HEVC compression (30 videos +  MOS and DMOS scores; size: 1.9 Gbytes)
Combined  spatial and temporal subsampling + HEVC compression (24 videos +  MOS scores; size: 1.2 Gbytes)
