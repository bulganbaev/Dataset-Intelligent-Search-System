Video-Classification-Assignment
This is an Ipython Notebook to demonstrate Classification of Videos on Running and Jogging data with 2 datasets of 52 samples of both running and jogging videos.
For implementing the code at your end implement each cell one by one. The only thing you need to change is set the directory of the dataset based on where you kept the dataset.
Rest is easy running and executing each cell.
#EDIT - 5TH JULY 2018
This assignment was given to me by Signzy for their internship recruitment. I was able to get a 67% accuracy which I think is not very good but I had a good time learning about video classification.
Finally I was not able to qualify for the next round but it was a fun and nice learning experience.
