       Dota2 is a free-to-play multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game. Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams of five players, with each team occupying and defending their own separate base on the map. Each of the ten players independentlycontrols a powerful character, known as a "hero" (which they choose at the start of the match), who all have unique abilities and differing styles of play.  
       During a match, players collect experience points and items for their heroes to successful battle with the opposing team's heroes, who attempt to do the same to them. A team wins by being the first to destroy a large structure located in the opposing team's base, called the "Ancient". 
       Youâ€™re given dataset of professional Dota players and their most frequent 10 heroes. The data also includes details about the heros (Kind of Hero (nuker, initiator and so on), their base attack, strength, movement speed). Here both train and test dataset is divided into two dataset(train9.csv &amp; train1.csv and test9.csv &amp; test1.csv).
