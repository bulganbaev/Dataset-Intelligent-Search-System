A Synchronization Ground Truth for the Jiku Mobile Video Dataset
This is the synchronization ground truth for the Jiku Mobile Video Dataset as described in the paper:

M. Guggenberger, M. Lux, and L. Böszörmenyi. A Synchronization Ground Truth for the Jiku Mobile Video Dataset. In MultiMedia Modeling, Lecture Notes in Computer Science. Springer International Publishing, 2015.

The ground truth XML files are stored in the groundtruth directory. The metadata directory contains scripts to download and extract geo data (location and direction) from the dataset's metadata XML files and display them on a graphical map. An overview of the ground truth data is available on the accompanying website.
