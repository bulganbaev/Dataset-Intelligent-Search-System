VehicleTrajectoryDataset
Scripts of the dataset corresponding to the paper 3D Vehicle Trajectory Reconstruction in Monocular Video Data Using Environment Structure Constraints.
The actual dataset can be requested on this Fraunhofer IOSB webpage.
Download the following files from the ftp server:
ground_truth_data.tar.gz
rendering_data.tar.gz
Extract these into the same folder  (i.e. merge the contents)
That means,  should show the following structure:
<dataset>
	general_ground_truth_files
	path_car_1_obj
	path_car_2_obj
	path_car_3_obj
	path_car_4_obj
	path_car_5_obj
	path_car_6_obj
	path_car_7_obj

In order to create convenient ground truth files clone this repository with the following command to make sure the submodule is correctly initialized:
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/SBCV/VehicleTrajectoryDataset.git

Run the following command:
python Post_Processing.py

to automatically create a local copy of the config files.
This will create two config files, i.e.
VehicleTrajectoryDataset/Utility/CloudCompare/CloudCompare.cfg
VehicleTrajectoryDataset/Config/config.cfg

The script relies on CloudCompare CloudCompare to transform Vehicle Meshes. At least version 2.10 is required. Set the path in CloudCompare.cfg to your CloudCompare executable.
In config.cfg adjust the path pointing to the downloaded dataset.
Run the following command (again) to post-process the dataset:
python Post_Processing.py

Calibration of the camera used for rendering:
focal_length: 2100 [pixel]
cx = 960 [pixel] and cy = 540 [pixel] 
(No radial distortion)
width = 1920 [pixel] and height = 1080 [pixel]
stereo_baseline = 0.3 [meter]
