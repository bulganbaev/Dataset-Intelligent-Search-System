Real_time_Object_detection_TF
We worked on a project based on Deep Learning and we are able to detect objects through an image, a video and real-time(web cam and cellphone camera)
This is an implementation of tensor flow object detection API for running it in Real time through Webcam and cellphone camera.

Download the object_recognition_detection.zip
For running the object detection on image files run the object_detection_tutorial.py
For running the object detection in realtime with web camera run the object_detection_webcam.py
For running the object detection in realtime with cellphone camera run the object_detection_phone.py
