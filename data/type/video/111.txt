YouTube Video Classification
Using the Python3 library, scikit learn, we implemented various algorithms tasked with classifying a video into one of ten categories.
The video's title, tags and description are used in the classification.

How To Use
Clone the repo and then extract filteredset.7z from the datasets folder and move it into the same location as run_tests.py.
Type python3 run_tests.py to execute.
This will take a long time as it runs seven different algorithms, ten times each, while shuffling the data each time.
