Devnagri Hindi Character Recognition By Hand Gesture
You can install Conda for python which resolves all the dependencies for machine learning.
This code successfully recognizes hindi characters.
Technique Used
I have used convolutional neural networks.
I am using Tensorflow as the framework and Keras API for providing a high level of abstraction.
Architecture
CONV2D --> MAXPOOL --> CONV2D --> MAXPOOL -->FC -->Softmax--> Classification
Some additional points

You can go for additional conv layers.
Add regularization to prevent overfitting.
You can add additional images to the training set for increasing the accuracy.

Python  Implementation

Dataset- DHCD (Devnagari Character Dataset)
Images of size 32 X 32
Convolutional Network Support added.




Predicted Value is Checked and displayed at Bottom.
