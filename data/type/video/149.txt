YouTube-US-Trending-Videos-Data.
Context
YouTube (the world-famous video sharing website) maintains a list of the top trending videos on the platform. According to Variety magazine, “To determine the year’s top-trending videos, YouTube uses a combination of factors including measuring users interactions (number of views, shares, comments and likes). Note that they’re not the most-viewed videos overall for the calendar year”. Top performers on the YouTube trending list are music videos (such as the famously virile “Gangam Style”), celebrity and/or reality TV performances, and the random dude-with-a-camera viral videos that YouTube is well-known for.
This dataset is a daily record of the top trending YouTube videos in US.
Content
Data includes the video title, channel title, publish time, tags, views, likes and dislikes, description, and comment count.
