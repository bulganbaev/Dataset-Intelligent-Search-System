Face-Dataset-Generator
Reads a video file, detects faces from each frame, saves the frames in some* folder and saves the cropped faces in another* folder.

Replace 'file_name.mp4' in line 6 with your video file name.
To change path, name format

Modify line 27 (for frames)
Modify line 39 (for cropped faces)


Line number 13, 20, 36 (Uncomment these lines to realize the faces get detected frame by frame, will slow down the saving process)
Increase FD to reduce the number of similar frames in the dataset.
