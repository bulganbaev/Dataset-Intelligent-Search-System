Installation
Anaconda 2019.03 distribution Python 3.6
Project Motivation
Using the Cross-Industry Standard Process of Data Mining (CRISP-DM), we are analysing this dataset which contains a list of video games with sales greater than 100,000 copies. It scraped from vgchartz.com and available on kaggle and following four questions are focused upon:
What revenue game sales generate and how many games releases every year?
which publishers are leader by game revenue and games releases?
Which game genre has highest releases and love by people?
Can we make a regression model to predict the sales price?
This repository consists of:
Two descrptive Jupyter Notebook python 3.7 file A datasets: 16598 Rows and 11 columns
This project follows the CRISP-DM approach Jupyter Notebook and A Medium Blog post on the following link: https://medium.com/@imBharatMishra/understanding-crisp-dm-using-video-game-sales-data-a2d55c7a2593
