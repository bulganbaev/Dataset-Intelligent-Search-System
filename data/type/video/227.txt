Retrieving the videos
First, install the youtube_dl program from here: https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl. Next, download urls.txt and run the following command:
youtube-dl -o "META_DATA_FILE_PATH/vid.%(id)s.%(ext)s" --batch-file urls.txt --restrict-filenames --write-info-json --recode-video mp4 --sleep-interval 20 --max-sleep-interval 50

This will retrieve the videos and meta-data from YouTube. If you would like to refine the meta-data files and eliminate potentially irrelevant information like the video playback quality options, then download and run:
python pack_data.py META_DATA_FILE_PATH CLEAN_META_DATA_FILE_PATH
