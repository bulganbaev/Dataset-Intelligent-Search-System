The code in this repo is for the Gender Classification challenge for the video 'Learn Python for Data Science #1' by @Sirajology (Siraj Raval) on YouTube. Although not an official submission (I was late to discover these awesome challenges), this is my attempt at it. The dataset for this challenge can be downloaded from Kaggle. This code downloads the dataset, cleans it, creates feature vectors, then uses T-SNE to reduce the dimensionality of the feature vectors to just 2. Then, we use matplotlib to visualize the data.
Dependencies

numpy (http://www.numpy.org/)
scikit-learn (http://scikit-learn.org/)
matplotlib (http://matplotlib.org/)
