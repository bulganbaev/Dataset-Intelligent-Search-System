I wrote this small scrit to take care of a pressing need. I downloaded the entire UCF101 video dataset from [4] hoping to use
one of the train-test splits specified in many research works. However, I soon found out that some videos from the train-test
split 1 list downloaded from [1] did not exist.
I have written this script therefore to help me download all videos as they apply to the train-test split downloaded from [1]
