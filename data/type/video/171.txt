Object-Tracking-In-Infrared
This project explores object tracking of human and vehicle targets in the infrared using Matlab. Using the OTCBVS Benchmark Dataset Collection, tracking of pedestrians are performed in a variety of infrared videos. Tracking is performed in cases with single pedestrians in the scene and also in cases with multiple pedestrians. Tracking approaches is centered on techniques most suited to the infrared. The project will not focus on identification of targets but instead on maintenance of accurate track following the identification. Performance of the developed tracking techniques are analyzed using the ground truth data from the databases. Metrics, such as those from the IEEE workshop on Performance Evaluation of Tracking and Surveillance is used for the analysis. All coding is done in MATLAB.
