DukeMTMC-VideoReID
DukeMTMC-VideoReID [1] is a subset of the DukeMTMC tracking dataset [2] for video-based person re-identification.
The dataset consists of 702 identities for training, 702 identities for testing, and 408 identities as distractors. In total there are 2,196 videos for training and 2,636 videos for testing. Each video contains person images sampled every 12 frames. During testing, a video for each ID is used as the query and the remaining videos are placed in the gallery.
Download Dataset
Data Offline. Since the privacy implications of the data set are being considered, we have to offline the download link for DukeMTMC-VideoReID. We are very sorry about it. There is currently no clear indication as to when, if ever, the data set will be allowed to be restored.
You may try the following download link to check whether the data set is restored officially.

About Dataset



Directory
Description




./train
The training video tracklets. It contains 702 identities.


./query
The query video tracklets. Each of them is from different identities in different cameras.


./gallery
The gallery video tracklets. It contains 702 gallery identities and 408 distractors.



Directory Structure
Followings are the directory structure for DukeMTMC-VideoReID.

Splits

Person ids

Video tracklet ids

Frame bounding box images




For example, for one frame image train/0001/0003/0001_C6_F0099_X30823.jpg, train, 0001, 0003, and 0001_C6_F0099_X30823.jpg are the split, person id, video tracklet id, and image frame name, respectively.
Naming Rules for image file.
For most frame bounding box images, e.g. 0001_C6_F0099_X30823.jpg, "0001" is the identity. "C6" indicate Camera 6. "F0099" means it is the 99th frame within the tracklet. "X" indicates it is a normal image (otherwise, "D" for distractors) and " 30823" is the 30823th frame in the whole video of Camera 6.
Training Baseline model
ETAP-Net
The baseline model is an end-to-end ResNet-50 model with temporal average pooling (ETAP-Net).
More details about the ETAP-Net can be found in our CVPR2018 paper Exploit the Unknown Gradually: One-Shot Video-Based Person Re-Identification by Stepwise Learning.
