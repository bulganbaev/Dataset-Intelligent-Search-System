This web application is developed using JavaScript, jQuery, and D3.js. According to our test, the application can run properly on Apache v2.4.29 on Windows.

How to run the application


Set up the Apache server.


Put all the project files in the Apache web root folder (Eg: "Apache24\htdocs" on Windows)


Start the Apache server


Open a web browser, and in the address bar enter the IP address bound to the Apache server (Eg: "localhost" in default). Then press Enter and the browser would navigate to the index page of the web application.
