Steps to make MySQL work with Django

Install MySQL version 5.7
You might need to add the location of the mysql.exe to the Path variable. It will be something like C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.7\bin.
Open a MySQL session (run mysql -u  -p at the cmd prompt)
Open a connection to the database and create a database named mytunesdb. This is the name of the database in the settings.py file
Get the right *.whl from https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#mysqlclient
Assuming pip is installed run (you can do this using windows powershell): pip install <name of the *.whl from step2>
Install mysqlclient: pip install mysqlclient
Got to the myTunes directory with the manage.py file and run the command: python manage.py dbshell

If you get to the mysql prompt you are set.
In order to use the login functionality, you have to create a site.
Type the lines below in the python shell:


from django.contrib.sites.models import Site


new_site = Site.objects.create(domain='mytunes.com', name='mytunes.com')


print(new_site.id)


You will have to update the settings.py file if your site doesn't have ID of 2
