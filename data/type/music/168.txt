music_genre_classification_deeplearning
We are developing a deep neural network based music classification engine, with Million Song Dataset as the main input. The aim of the project, in the initial phase, is to classify the genre of songs. User will input a song (mp3 or wav file) and the neural network will classify the song based on its features.
