osu-dataset
A public dataset containing chord/beat annotation from a music game named 'osu!'.
What is it used for

It was not yet a formal dataset for training of chord recognition/beat tracking, but it is okay if you just want to test your ACE (Automatic Chord Estimation) system against some modern music pieces.
The annotation was initially used for testing rhythm-based music visualization schemes.

Where to get the audio tracks

We do NOT own copyright for the audio tracks, and they are not presented in this repo.

Osu! currently allows you to get these audio tracks freely and legally under its DMCA, but be sure to deal with them properly, following their DMCA and pay attention to copyright infringements from artists.
