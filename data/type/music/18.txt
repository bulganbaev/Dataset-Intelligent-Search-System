Music Genre Classification Dataset
A subset of the MARD dataset was created for genre classification experiments. It contains 100 albums by genre from different artists, from 13 different genres (Alternative Rock, Classical, Country, Dance & Electronic, Folk, Jazz, Latin Music, Metal, New Age, Pop, R&B, Rap & Hip-Hop, Rock). All the albums have been mapped to MusicBrainz and AcousticBrainz. It contains linguistic and sentiment features. It is stored as a dictionary, where the keys are the amazon-ids. The file is called classification_dataset.json
We also provide all the necessary files to reproduce the experiments on genre classification in the paper referenced below. entity_features_dataset.json contains the entities and categories identified in the reviews for every album, entity_features_dataset_broader.json contains also the broader Wikipedia categories, genre_classification.py is the Python script used for the experiment. Finally, train_x.csv and test_x.csv contains the 5 different splits in the dataset used for cross validation.
