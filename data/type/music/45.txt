Sheet ID
This repository contains the code used in "Sheet Music Identification Using Measure-Based CNN Features" by Hubinger, Khant, Kurashige, Amin, and Tsai.
Installation
To install this repository, you will need to

git clone https://github.com/evhub/score-retrieval.git,
download the data to /score-retrieval-data or ./data,
install the CNN code,
install the measure segmentation code, and
make install.

Usage
First, you will need to ensure your data is properly set up. If you only have PDFs but not images, you will need to run make pdfs-to-images.
Then, to run the system, simply
python ./score_retrieval/run_all.py --alg <alg_name>

where <alg_name> is one of the following:

measure_segmentation to run our best system using measure segmentation,
vgg_measure_segmentation to run base vgg-gem with measure segmentation, and
tuned_measure_segmentation to run measure segmentation utilizing a fine-tuned network.

To run tuned_measure_segmentation, you will need to have previously run fine-tuning on the training data.
