MUSCIMA
The mung (Music Notation Graph) package implements a graph representation
of music notation that is especially amenable to Optical Music Recognition (OMR).
It was used for instance in the MUSCIMA++ dataset of music notation.





This package should work with both Python 2.7 and Python 3.6,
although the doctest-based test suite only works on Python 3.
Getting started

Install this package: pip install mung
Download the MUSCIMA++ dataset.
