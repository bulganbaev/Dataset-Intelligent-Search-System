Chinook Database Queries
These are exercises querying the Chinook Database utilizing SQLite and DB Browser. The Chinook Dataset mimics a music service account database, so there are tables for Artists, Albums, Tracks, Playlists, Customers, Employees, and Invoices as outlined in the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) below.
Check Out the Chinook Database on Codeplex
ERD can be found here
Queries
Look in the sql directory for all the SQL files and queries. Each file contains a specific data extraction objective.
Query Example (found in sql/26_top_3_artis.sql)

Provide a query that shows the top 3 best selling artists.

SELECT a.Name 'Artist', sum(li.UnitPrice) 'Total Sold' 
FROM InvoiceLine li, Track t, Album al, Artist a
WHERE li.TrackId = t.Trackid 
	and al.AlbumId = t.AlbumId 
	and a.ArtistId = al.ArtistId
GROUP BY a.Name
ORDER BY COUNT(a.ArtistId) DESC
limit 3;
