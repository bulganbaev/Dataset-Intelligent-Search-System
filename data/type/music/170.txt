Rap Lyrics Generator
An LSTM implementation for a Rap Lyric Generator that spawns rap lyrics based on a Kaggle dataset with over 38,000 lines.
In order to run the Generator, the following must be done after getting into the Generator's working directory:

Unzip the dataset through the two following commands:

sudo apt-get install unzip

unzip lyrics.csv.zip


Train the LSTM network through the following command:

python train.py


Generate new lyrics through the following command:

python run.py -s <seed>

The 'seed' parser argument can be replaced for anything, such as a word, phrase or line. It is simply the starting point of generating the text.
The features of the Rap Lyrics Generator include:

Ability to create lyrics based on a seed
Generates 1000 character lyric outputs
Trains efficiently
Utilizes rap lyrics from various artists, such as Kanye West and Kendrick Lamar, to learn

The Rap Lyrics Generator requires the following to be installed on the system:

Python 3
Tensorflow
Keras
Numpy
Pandas
