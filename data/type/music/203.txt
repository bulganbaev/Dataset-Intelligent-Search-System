Classify-Song-Genres-from-Audio-Data
Using a dataset comprised of songs of two music genres (Hip-Hop and Rock), we will train a classifier to distinguish between the two genres based only on track information derived from Echonest.
We will first make use of pandas and seaborn packages in Python for subsetting the data, aggregating information, and creating plots when exploring the data for obvious trends or factors we should be aware of when doing machine learning.
Next, we will use the scikit-learn package to predict whether we can correctly classify a song's genre based on features such as danceability, energy, acousticness, tempo, etc.
We will go over implementations of common algorithms such as PCA, logistic regression, decision trees, and so forth.
