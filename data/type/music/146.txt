Motivations
Predicting churn rates is a challenging and common problem that data scientists and analysts regularly encounter in any customer-facing business. Additionally, the ability to efficiently manipulate large datasets with Spark is one of the highest-demand skills in the field of data.
This repo is to uplevel my spark skills essentially with: how to manipulate large and realistic datasets with Spark to engineer relevant features for predicting churn. Learn how to use Spark MLlib to build machine learning models with large datasets, far beyond what could be done with non-distributed technologies like scikit-learn.
