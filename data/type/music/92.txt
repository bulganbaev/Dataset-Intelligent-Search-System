Music Recommendation
This is a small training project and the main purpose is to get more experience in building deep learning models for structured data. Another objective is to create REST API with Flask to serve the model.
In this project I create and train the model for dataset https://www.kaggle.com/c/kkbox-music-recommendation-challenge/data. The aim is to predict if a user will listen a song for a second time within a month after the first time. Based on this information a recommendation system can be built.
Cleaning the data, creating and training the model
The corresponding notebook with step by step explanation is data_cleaning_and_model_training.ipynb.
Serving the model using REST API
The file that creates REST API to serve the model is Model_Server.py.
Testing
To test the server, you can use notebook test_model_server_on_sample_data.ipynb. In this notebook the request is created to sent to the running server and get the response. Make sure the server is ready to receive requests before running the test.
