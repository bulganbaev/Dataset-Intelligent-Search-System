Machine readable datasets
A collection of open, machine readable music documents from all over the Web
Motivation
Scientific studies over multi-format symbolic music notation are currently impossible. Mostly due to the siloed nature of all such open data on the Web.
These analyses require large collections of files directly downloadable for large scale number crunching.
Criteria for inclusion

Machine readable
Open license
Directly downloadable via a URL
