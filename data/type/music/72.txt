Music Stretching Resistance Dataset
This is a dataset consisting of the music stretching resistance of 894 songs of various genres.
Music stretching resistance (MSR) measures the acceptable range of time stretching rate of music piece for people’s psychoacoustic hearing.
The MSR of a single song consists of two values: the maximum elongating rate and the minimum compressing rate,
within which range this song can be safely stretched using methods like WSOLA.
The distribution of songs with respect to each genre is shown below:

The MSR values of each song are listed in the file msr.txt.
Each line shows the MSR of a unique song with the following format:
song name \t artist name \t genre \t the minimum compressing rate \t the maximum elongating rate.
The fields are separated with \t.

In IEEE Signal Processing Letters 2013, we proposed a MSR classification algorithm combining music content features and genres based on this dataset.
In Multimedia Modeling 2014, we proposed a tool to automatically estimate the MSR of a user-uploaded song and alert the user about the safe and dangerous stretching ranges on the sliding bar.
It also supports music stretching as well as playing.
In the arxiv paper, we conducted thorough analysis on the MSR values in this dataset. Some interesting findings were presented and discussed in detail.
