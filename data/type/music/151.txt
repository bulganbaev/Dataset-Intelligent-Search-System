The code structure is split across a few key files

features.py = has functions related to feature extraction
classifier.py = has functions realated to running sklearn classifiers
validation.py = has functions related to running k fold validation
run.py = has data related to running the script
launch.py = runs the launcher script

When the code is run, the features for test and training sets will be generated, this will create new csv files for each of these features.
This script may take about 30 minutes to run, because building the features (mainly FFTs) takes a long time.
to run the project and display testing results run:
./launcher.sh
Also note!!! The test / train data is not included,
you'll need to create a folder called "genres" with the train songs inside it (organized by folder)
and you'll need to create a folder called "test" with all of the test files in it
