Kaggle-Music-Recommendation-Machine-learning
Chose Kaggle competition of Music Recommendation System which involves application of various machine learning methodologies.
By using the dataset from KKBox which includes 10 million rows, we will be predicting the chances that a user will listen to the song again within a time window.
It involves preprocessing of datasets along with the cross validation so as to get better results.
The best classifier was LGBM giving an accuracy of 66.65%.
The various classifiers used are:
-ANN
-Deep Learning
-Gradient Boosting
-Naive Bayes
-Random Forest
-Support Vector Machines
