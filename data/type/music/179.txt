Wrangling and Visualizing Musical Data in R
Project Description
Apply data-wrangling and visualization tools from the tidyverse to musical data. Find the most common chords and chord  progressions in a sample of pop/rock music from the 1950s-1990s, and compare the styles of different artists. This project  assumes familiarity with standard TidyVerse tools for R, in particular the tibble data structure and the dplyr and ggplot2  packages. No specific musical knowledge is required, though it may give you ideas for further exploration of the dataset  after completing the project.This project uses a parsed and cleaned version of the McGill Billboard Dataset,  version 2.0 (CC0 license).
Before taking on this project its recommend that you have the following knowledges in R:
i)Uses of Tidyverse Package in R
ii)Data Visualization with ggplot2 in R
