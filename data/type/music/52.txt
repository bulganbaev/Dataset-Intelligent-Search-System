Data extracts and analysis from the NASA wake-up call project. This is a remix
project. Source Data is licensed to NASA. If NASA would like to commit to a
creative-commons license for this work to be used more widely, that would be
lovely.
Credit for the source material goes to Colin Fries of the NASA historical
division.
Process and Requirements
When there is an opportunity I will walk people back through the process and
requirements too. I started but as the process of converting the data from
PDF to JSON continued it became more and more difficult - it was not
straightforward.
I will also list the tools and the order to run them.
I will follow up!
Questions without answers
I have questions I want to meditate on:

Has the process been lossless?
Has the source material been diluted?
Is the transformative nature of this work worth it?
It was expensive, how expensive was it?
How would these costs compare to those in my subject discipline of
digital-preservation?
Does this work fit in the digital-humanities?
Is it sustainable?
Would I do it again??? (Yes, but after a holiday!)

What next?

Playlists! And greater access to the data.
I want to find more tools to explore the data with.

Visdata looks great! http://visidata.org/


I will start to edit the data using source control as a way of managing those
edits.

Please do
Visit https://nasawakeupcalls.github.io/ and enjoy what's there for now. Please
let me know how it can be expanded upon.
If you're NASA and don't want to sue me! Please also say hi! I would love to
work with you.
