Scraping scripts
This repository contains scripts to scrape data from internet and then transform it to format that could be easily imported into database.
Scraping data from internet


Install Scrapy: pip install scrapy


Register at http://www.last.fm/api to obtain Last.FM API key, then save it as a file /data/last_fm_api.key


Run scripts in this order:
scrapy runspider genre_sprider.py -o data/genres.jl \
&& scrapy runspider playlist_spider.py -o data/spotify_playlists.jl \
&& scrapy runspider songs_spider.py -o data/songs.jl \
&& scrapy runspider tags_spider.py -o data/tags.jl



When process finishes (it could take several minutes or maybe hours), the following files should be present in /data folder:

genres.jl
songs.jl
spotify_playlists.jl
tags.jl

Data size: ~100 MB
Scraping time: ~2,5 hours
Transforming data to CSV format
Run python scripts in folder /csv-scripts in arbitrary order, they should create output files with corresponding names in folder /data/csv.
Importing into database
CSV files generates in previous step should be easily importable into database (tested just on PostgreSQL). After import is finished, run SQL script /sql-scripts/tag.tag_is_genre.sql. to fill up tags.tag_is_genre column.
