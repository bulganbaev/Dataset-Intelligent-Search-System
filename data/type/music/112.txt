Music-recommender-system
This project recommends song to a user based on song ratings. These ratings are not present in the dataset so I have used play count feature of the dataset and calculated ratings for each song. The dataset is formed using three datasets-

MillionSongDataset- https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/
MusicXMatch-https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/musixmatch.
Genre- http://www.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/mir/msd/partitions/msd-topMAGD-partition_percentageSplit_0.8-v1.0.cls
