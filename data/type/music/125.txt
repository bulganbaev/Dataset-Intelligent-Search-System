Music-Genre-Classification
This is a Keras implementation to classify genre of audio files from GTZAN Genre Collection using Neural Networks.
Todo:

 Instead of applying dense neural networks, convert audio files to spectrogram images and apply cnn model
 Model is overfitting, therefore, apply regularisation
 Other dataset that can be used is Audio set dataset made available by Google Inc.
